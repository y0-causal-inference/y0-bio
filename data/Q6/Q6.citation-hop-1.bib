abstract = {Pulmonary dysfunction develops in type 2 diabetes mellitus ({T2DM}) in direct correlation with glycemia and is exacerbated by obesity; however, the associated structural derangement has not been quantified. We studied lungs from obese diabetic (fa/fa) male Zucker diabetic fatty ({ZDF}) rats at 4, 12, and 36 wk of age, before and after onset of {T2DM}, compared with lean nondiabetic (+/+) rats. Surfactant proteins A and C ({SP}-A and {SP}-C) immunoexpression in lung tissue was quantified at ages 14 and 18 wk, after the onset of {T2DM}. In fa/fa animals, lung volume was normal despite obesity. Numerous lipid droplets were visible within alveolar interstitium, lipofibroblasts, and macrophages, particularly in subpleural regions. Total triglyceride content was 136\% higher. By 12 wk, septum volume was 21\% higher, and alveolar duct volume was 36\% lower. Capillary basement membrane was 29\% thicker. Volume of lamellar bodies was 45\% higher. By age 36 wk, volumes of interstitial collagen fibers, cells, and matrix were respectively 32, 25, and 80\% higher, and capillary blood volume was 18\% lower. {ZDF} rats exhibited a strain-specific increase in resistance of the air-blood diffusion barrier with age, which was exaggerated in fa/fa lungs compared with +/+ lungs. In fa/fa lungs, {SP}-A and {SP}-C expression were elevated at age 14-18 wk; the normal age-related increase in {SP}-A expression was accelerated, whereas {SP}-C expression declined with age. Thus lungs from obese {T2DM} animals develop many qualitatively similar changes as in type 1 diabetes mellitus but with extensive lipid deposition, altered alveolar type 2 cell ultrastructure, and surfactant protein expression patterns that suggest additive effects of hyperglycemia and lipotoxicity.}

abstract = {Newborn children of diabetic mothers have an increased morbidity and mortality because of respiratory distress syndrome. We study lung histogenesis during intrauterine development of offspring of diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats at 18, 19 and 21 days of gestation ({DG}). Pregnant rats were grouped into diabetic (streptozotocin-induced), citrate, and control groups; five female and five male offspring were selected randomly from each group at 18, 19 and 21 {DG}, and a biopsy of the lung was taken and processed in paraffin for histological examination. The biopsy for the transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) analysis was taken at 21 days. A delay in alveolization of the offspring at 18, 19 and 21 days of the diabetic group was observed, which was confirmed at {TEM} level, and also less quantity of protein D associated to surfactant in diabetic group was detected (P \textless 0.001). The foetuses of the diabetic group presented a delay in lung histogenesis and in differentiation of the type {II} pneumocytes cells, but conserved the proportion with a decrease in 50\% of pneumocytes, accompanied by a diminish of protein D associated to surfactant factor.}
