We evaluate at both the *abstract level* (i.e. how many research abstracts did the model correctly identify), and the *sentence level* (i.e. how well did the model identify the relevant evidence from the cited abstracts). For more information, see Section 4 of the [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.609/). For more information, see this [detailed example](https://github.com/allenai/scifact/blob/master/doc/evaluation.md), which shows how evaluation would be performed on a formatted example submission.\n",
