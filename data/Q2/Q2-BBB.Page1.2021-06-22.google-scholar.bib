abstract = {The ongoing worldwide pandemic of the novel human coronavirus {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and the ensuing disease, {COVID}-19, has presented enormous and unprecedented challenges for all medical specialists. However, to date, children, especially neonates, have been relatively spared from the devastating consequences of this infection. Neurologic involvement is being increasingly recognized among adults with {COVID}-19, who can develop sensory deficits in smell and taste, delirium, encephalopathy, headaches, strokes, and peripheral nervous system disorders. Among neonates and children, {COVID}-19-associated neurological manifestations have been relatively rare, yet reports involving neurologic dysfunction in this age range are increasing. As discussed in this review, pediatric neurologists and other pediatric specialists should be alert to potential neurological involvement by this virus, which might have neuroinvasive capability and carry long-term neuropsychiatric and medical consequences.}

abstract = {Neurological disorders caused by neuroviral infections are an obvious pathogenic manifestation. However, non-neurotropic viruses or peripheral viral infections pose a considerable challenge as their neuropathological manifestations do not emerge because of primary infection. Their secondary or bystander pathologies develop much later, like a syndrome, during and after the recovery of patients from the primary disease. Massive inflammation caused by peripheral viral infections can trigger multiple neurological anomalies. These neurological damages may range from a general cognitive and motor dysfunction up to a wide spectrum of {CNS} anomalies, such as Acute Necrotizing Hemorrhagic Encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Encephalitis, Meningitis, anxiety, and other audio-visual disabilities. Peripheral viruses like Measles virus, Enteroviruses, Influenza viruses ({HIN1} series), {SARS}-{CoV}-1, {MERS}-{CoV}, and, recently, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 are reported to cause various neurological manifestations in patients and are proven to be neuropathogenic even in cellular and animal model systems. This review presents a comprehensive picture of {CNS} susceptibilities toward these peripheral viral infections and explains some common underlying themes of their neuropathology in the human brain.

abstract = {At the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) was discovered in China, causing a new coronavirus disease, termed {COVID}-19 by the {WHO} on February 11, 2020. At the time of this paper (January 31, 2021), more than 100 million cases have been recorded, which have claimed over 2 million lives worldwide. The most important clinical presentation of {COVID}-19 is severe pneumonia; however, many patients present various neurological symptoms, ranging from loss of olfaction, nausea, dizziness, and headache to encephalopathy and stroke, with a high prevalence of inflammatory central nervous system ({CNS}) syndromes. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 may also target the respiratory center in the brainstem and cause silent hypoxemia. However, the neurotropic mechanism(s) by which {SARS}-{CoV}-2 affects the {CNS} remain(s) unclear. In this paper, we first address the involvement of astrocytes in {COVID}-19 and then elucidate the present knowledge on {SARS}-{CoV}-2 as a neurotropic virus as well as several other neurotropic flaviviruses (with a particular emphasis on the West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Zika virus) to highlight the neurotropic mechanisms that target astroglial cells in the {CNS}. These key homeostasis-providing cells in the {CNS} exhibit many functions that act as a favorable milieu for virus replication and possibly a favorable environment for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 as well. The role of astrocytes in {COVID}-19 pathology, related to aging and neurodegenerative disorders, and environmental factors, is discussed. Understanding these mechanisms is key to better understanding the pathophysiology of {COVID}-19 and for developing new strategies to mitigate the neurotropic manifestations of {COVID}-19.

abstract = {Viral infections may cause neurological disorders by directly inducing oxidative stress and interrupting immune system function, both of which contribute to neuronal death. Several reports have described the neurological manifestations in Covid-19 patients where, in severe cases of the infection, brain inflammation and encephalitis are common. Recently, extensive research-based studies have revealed and acknowledged the clinical and preventive roles of melatonin in some viral diseases. Melatonin has been shown to have antiviral properties against several viral infections which are accompanied by neurological symptoms. The beneficial properties of melatonin relate to its properties as a potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory molecule and its neuroprotective effects. In this review, what is known about the therapeutic role of melatonin in virus-induced neuropathogenesis is summarized and discussed.}
