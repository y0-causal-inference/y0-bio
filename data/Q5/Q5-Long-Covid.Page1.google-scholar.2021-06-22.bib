abstract = {The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans. Similar to its homologous virus, {SARS}-{CoV}, which caused {SARS} in thousands of people in 2003, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, {COVID}-19 has lower severity and mortality than {SARS} but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease. Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease. \copyright The author(s).}

abstract = {The adaptive immune system is important for control of most viral infections. The three fundamental components of the adaptive immune system are B cells (the source of antibodies), {CD4}+ T cells, and {CD8}+ T cells. The armamentarium of B cells, {CD4}+ T cells, and {CD8}+ T cells has differing roles in different viral infections and in vaccines, and thus it is critical to directly study adaptive immunity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to understand {COVID}-19. Knowledge is now available on relationships between antigen-specific immune responses and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. Although more studies are needed, a picture has begun to emerge that reveals that {CD4}+ T cells, {CD8}+ T cells, and neutralizing antibodies all contribute to control of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in both non-hospitalized and hospitalized cases of {COVID}-19. The specific functions and kinetics of these adaptive immune responses are discussed, as well as their interplay with innate immunity and implications for {COVID}-19 vaccines and immune memory against re-infection.

In 11 months since its first emergence, according to {WHO}, the causative infectious agent {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has infected more than 100 million people and claimed more than 2.15 million lives worldwide. Moreover, the world has raced to understand the virus and natural immunity and to develop vaccines. Thus, within a short 11 months a number of highly promising {COVID}-19 vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed and are now being deployed via emergency use authorization for immunization. Although a considerable number of review contributions are being published, all of them attempt to capture only a specific aspect of {COVID}-19 or its therapeutic approaches based on ever-expanding information. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview to conceptually thread together the latest information on global epidemiology and mitigation strategies, clinical features, viral pathogenesis and immune responses, and the current state of vaccine development. \copyright 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms of {COVID}-19, along with fever and loss of taste and smell. Cough can persist for weeks or months after {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, often accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, dyspnoea, or pain-a collection of long-term effects referred to as the post-{COVID} syndrome or long {COVID}. We hypothesise that the pathways of neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmunomodulation through the vagal sensory nerves, which are implicated in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, lead to a cough hypersensitivity state. The post-{COVID} syndrome might also result from neuroinflammatory events in the brain. We highlight gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of acute and chronic {COVID}-19-associated cough and post-{COVID} syndrome, consider potential ways to reduce the effect of {COVID}-19 by controlling cough, and suggest future directions for research and clinical practice. Although neuromodulators such as gabapentin or opioids might be considered for acute and chronic {COVID}-19 cough, we discuss the possible mechanisms of {COVID}-19-associated cough and the promise of new anti-inflammatories or neuromodulators that might successfully target both the cough of {COVID}-19 and the post-{COVID} syndrome.

abstract = {Post-{COVID} syndrome also known as long {COVID} refers to symptoms persisting for more than three weeks after the diagnosis of {COVID}-19. We reviewed the current evidence on post-{COVID} syndrome, focusing on its clinical manifestations and addressing the challenges for its management in primary healthcare. The incidence of post-{COVID} syndrome is estimated at 10-35\%, while for hospitalized patients it may reach 85\%. Fatigue is the most common symptom reported in 17.5-72\% of post-{COVID} cases, followed by residual dyspnea with an incidence ranging from 10-40\%. Mental problems, chest pain, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may affect up to 26\%, 22\% and 11\% of patients, respectively. More than one third of patients with post-{COVID} syndrome have pre-existing comorbidities, hypertension and diabetes mellitus being the most common. Beyond the prolonged duration of symptoms, the scarce published data indicate that most patients with post-{COVID} syndrome have a good prognosis with no further complications or fatal outcomes reported. Given the clinical spectrum of patients with post-{COVID} syndrome, most of them will be managed by primary healthcare professionals, in conjunction with pre-existing or new co-morbidities, which, in turn, may increase the burden of {COVID}-19 on primary healthcare. In conclusion approximately 10\% of patients with {COVID}-19 may have symptoms persisting beyond three weeks, fulfilling the criteria of post-{COVID} syndrome. Primary healthcare professionals have a key role in the management of patients with post-{COVID} syndrome. Research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis, clinical spectrum, and prognosis of post-{COVID} syndrome. Copyright \copyright 2021 Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social ({IM\SS}).

abstract = {Vaccines constitute the most effective medications in public health as they control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases and reduce mortality. Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination. While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, anaphylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactions that are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications. The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem from activation of mast cells via Fc\varepsilon receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E ({IgE}) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type {IV} allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-{IgE}-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-{BioNTech} and Moderna {COVID}-19 {mRNA} vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in {AstraZeneca} and Johnson \& Johnson {COVID}-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against {COVID}-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include: The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the {COVID}-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with {COVID}-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal. Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different {COVID}-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy. Allergists' expertise in proper diagnosis and treatment of allergic reactions is vital for the screening of high-risk individuals.}

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), continues to spread globally despite the worldwide implementation of preventive measures to combat the disease. Although most {COVID}-19 cases are characterised by a mild, self-limiting disease course, a considerable subset of patients develop a more severe condition, varying from pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) to multi-organ failure ({MOF}). Progression of {COVID}-19 is thought to occur as a result of a complex interplay between multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, all of which may orchestrate {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and contribute to organ-specific tissue damage. In this respect, dissecting currently available knowledge of {COVID}-19 immunopathogenesis is crucially important, not only to improve our understanding of its pathophysiology but also to fuel the rationale of both novel and repurposed treatment modalities. Various immune-mediated pathways during {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection are relevant in this context, which relate to innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity. Pathological findings in tissue specimens of patients with {COVID}-19 provide valuable information with regard to our understanding of pathophysiology as well as the development of evidence-based treatment regimens. This review provides an updated overview of the main pathological changes observed in {COVID}-19 within the most commonly affected organ systems, with special emphasis on immunopathology. Current management strategies for {COVID}-19 include supportive care and the use of repurposed or symptomatic drugs, such as dexamethasone, remdesivir, and anticoagulants. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat {COVID}-19, and this requires appropriate measures to attenuate its spread and, above all, the development and implementation of effective vaccines. \copyright 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) was identified at the end of 2019. The disease caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was named {COVID}-19. The main purpose of this review was to provide an overview of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. {METHODS}: The authors searched the {MEDLINE} database for clinical studies related to virus characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, transmission mechanisms, and treatment options. {RESULTS}: As of January 27, 2021, the number of infected people and deaths associated with {COVID}-19 worldwide were approximately 100 million and 2 million, respectively. The manifestations of {COVID}-19 are variable, and the severity is affected by age and preexisting medical conditions. Children and adolescents are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Older adults, in comparison, may experience severe illness and have disproportionally elevated mortality. Among those who survive, some may experience enduring deficits. The viral load is particularly elevated in saliva and oropharynx, which constitute potential sources of infection. The diagnosis of the disease may be confounded by factors related to the replicating cycle of the virus, viral load, and sensitivity of the diagnostic method used. As of January 2021, {COVID}-19 has no cure but can be prevented. Its treatment is based on supportive care along with antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases with multiorgan involvement, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and hemodynamic support may be necessary. {CONCLUSIONS}: {COVID}-19 is a transmittable disease with a variable course. A substantial number of patients, particularly children, remain asymptomatic. Important advances have been made in the development of new treatments. However, the mortality in vulnerable populations remains elevated. {PRACTICAL} {IMPLICATIONS}: The elevated viral load in the oral cavity and pharynx suggests that oral health care professionals could get infected through occupational exposure. Providers should understand the variables that influence the yield of diagnostic studies because false-negative results can occur. Copyright \copyright 2021. Published by Elsevier Inc.}
