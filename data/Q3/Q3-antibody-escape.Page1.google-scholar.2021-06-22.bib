abstract = {Cases of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection in Manaus, Brazil, resurged in late 2020, despite high levels of previous infection there. Through genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021, we identified the emergence and circulation of a novel {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variant of concern, lineage P.1, that acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein ({K417T}, {E484K} and {N501Y}) associated with increased binding to the human {ACE2} receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around early November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.4-2.2 times more transmissible and 25-61\% more likely to evade protective immunity elicited by previous infection with non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness. One-Sentence Summary: We report the evolution and emergence of a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 lineage of concern associated with rapid transmission in Manaus.}

abstract = {Multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) vaccines show protective efficacy, which is most likely mediated by neutralizing antibodies recognizing the viral entry protein, spike. Because new {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants are emerging rapidly, as exemplified by the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages, it is critical to understand whether antibody responses induced by infection with the original {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus or current vaccines remain effective. In this study, we evaluate neutralization of a series of mutated spike pseudotypes based on divergence from {SARS}-{CoV} and then compare neutralization of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotype and individual mutations. Spike-specific monoclonal antibody neutralization is reduced dramatically; in contrast, polyclonal antibodies from individuals infected in early 2020 remain active against most mutated spike pseudotypes, but potency is reduced in a minority of samples. This work highlights that changes in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike can alter neutralization sensitivity and underlines the need for effective real-time monitoring of emerging mutations and their effect on vaccine efficacy.

abstract = {Understanding {SARS}-{CoV}-2 evolution and host immunity is critical to control {COVID}-19 pandemics. At the core is an arms-race between {SARS}-{CoV}-2 antibody and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) recognition, a function of the viral protein spike and, predominantly, of its receptor-binding-domain ({RBD}). Mutations in spike impacting antibody or {ACE2} binding are known, but the effect of mutation synergy is less explored. We engineered 22 spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses containing individual and combined mutations, and confirmed that {E484K} evades antibody neutralization elicited by infection or vaccination, a capacity augmented when complemented by {K417N} and {N501Y} mutations. In silico analysis provided an explanation for {E484K} immune evasion. E484 frequently engages in interactions with antibodies but not with {ACE2}. Importantly, we identified a novel amino acid of concern, S494, which shares a similar pattern. Using the already circulating mutation {S494P}, we found that it reduces antibody neutralization of convalescent sera. This amino acid emerges as an additional hotspot for immune evasion and a target for therapies, vaccines and diagnostics.}

abstract = {In the year since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) and with understanding of the etiology of the coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic, it has become clear that most infected individuals achieve some form of immunity against the virus with relatively few reported reinfections. A number of vaccines have already achieved emergency use authorization based on data from large phase 3 field efficacy clinical trials. However, our knowledge about the extent and durability of this immunity, and the breadth of vaccine coverage against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants is still evolving. In this narrative review, we summarize the latest and rapidly developing understanding of immunity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, including what we have learned about the key antigens of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (i.e., the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain), their importance in vaccine development, the immediate immune response to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, breadth of coverage of emerging {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants, contributions of preexisting immunity to related coronaviruses, and duration of immunity. We also discuss lessons from newer approaches, such as systems serology, that provide insights into molecular and cellular immune responses elicited and how they relate to the trajectory of infection, and potentially inform immune correlates of protection. We also briefly examine the limited research literature on immune responses in special populations, such as pregnant women and children. Copyright \copyright 2021 Fergie and Srivastava.}

abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 spillback from humans into domestic and wild animals has been well-documented. We compared variants of cell culture-expanded {SARS}-{CoV}-2 inoculum and virus recovered from four species following experimental exposure. Five nonsynonymous changes in nsp12, S, N and M genes were near fixation in the inoculum, but reverted to wild-type sequences in {RNA} recovered from dogs, cats and hamsters within 1-3 days post-exposure. Fourteen emergent variants were detected in viruses recovered from animals, including substitutions at spike positions H69, N501, and D614, which also vary in human lineages of concern. The rapidity of in vitro and in vivo {SARS}-{CoV}-2 selection reveals residues with functional significance during host-switching, illustrating the potential for spillback reservoir hosts to accelerate evolution, and demonstrating plasticity of viral adaptation in animal models.

The extent and duration of protective immunity after {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection is not fully understood. As such, the possibility of re-infection with {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Furthermore, cases of re-infection were mainly due to different variants or mutant {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Following the fast and pandemic-scale spread of {COVID}-19, mutations in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 have raised new diagnostic challenges which include the redesign of the oligonucleotide sequences used in {RT}-{PCR} assays to avoid potential primer-sample mismatches, and decrease sensitivities. Since the initial wave of the pandemic, some regions had experienced fresh outbreaks, predisposing people to be susceptible to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 re-infection.

abstract = {As vaccines against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 are now being rolled out, a better understanding of immunity to the virus; whether through infection, or passive or active immunisation, and the durability of this protection is required. This will benefit from the ability to measure {SARS}-{CoV}-2 immunity, ideally with rapid turnaround and without the need for laboratory-based testing. Current rapid point-of-care ({POC}) tests measure antibodies (Ab) against the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus, however, these tests provide no information on whether the antibodies can neutralise virus infectivity and are potentially protective, especially against newly emerging variants of the virus. Neutralising Antibodies ({NAb}) are emerging as a strong correlate of protection, but most current {NAb} assays require many hours or days, samples of venous blood, and access to laboratory facilities, which is especially problematic in resource-limited settings. We have developed a lateral flow {POC} test that can measure levels of {RBD}-{ACE2} neutralising antibodies from whole blood, with a result that can be determined by eye (semi-quantitative) or on a small instrument (quantitative), and results show high correlation with microneutralisation assays. This assay also provides a measure of total anti-{RBD} antibody, thereby providing evidence of exposure to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 or immunisation, regardless of whether {NAb} are present in the sample. By testing samples from immunised macaques, we demonstrate that this test is equally applicable for use with animal samples, and we show that this assay is readily adaptable to test for immunity to newly emerging {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants. Lastly, using a cohort of vaccinated humans, we demonstrate that our whole-blood test correlates closely with microneutralisation assay data (R 2 =0.75, p\textless0.0001), and that fingerprick whole blood samples are sufficient for this test. Accordingly, the {COVID}-19 {NAb}-test\texttrademark device described here can provide a rapid readout of immunity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 at the point of care.}
