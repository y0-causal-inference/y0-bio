abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic is an emerging threat to global public health. While our current understanding of {COVID}-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for {COVID}-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}). {ACE2} primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin {II} (Ang {II}) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}). Significant to {COVID}-19, {ACE2} is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in human cells, as it does for {SARS}-{CoV}. Many infected individuals develop {COVID}-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. {ACE2} is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with {COVID}-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. Comparatively, {ACE2} is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe {COVID}-19 cases. Interestingly, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection downregulates {ACE2} expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in {COVID}-19. Importantly, targeting {ACE2}/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking {ACE2} interaction with the S protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to curtail {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of {COVID}-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) {ACE2} as a receptor of {SARS}-{CoV}-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of {COVID}-19; 3) role of {ACE2} in the infection and pathogenesis of {SARS}; 4) potential pathogenic role of {ACE2} in {COVID}-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for {COVID}-19. \copyright The author(s).}

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), which causes {COVID}-19, utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) for entry into target cells. {ACE2} has been proposed as an interferon-stimulated gene ({ISG}). Thus, interferon-induced variability in {ACE2} expression levels could be important for susceptibility to {COVID}-19 or its outcomes. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, transcriptionally independent truncated isoform of {ACE2}, which we designate as {deltaACE2} ({dACE2}). We demonstrate that {dACE2}, but not {ACE2}, is an {ISG}. In The Cancer Genome Atlas, the expression of {dACE2} was enriched in squamous tumors of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. In vitro, {dACE2}, which lacks 356 amino-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. Our results suggest that the {ISG}-type induction of {dACE2} in {IFN}-high conditions created by treatments, an inflammatory tumor microenvironment or viral co-infections is unlikely to increase the cellular entry of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and promote infection.}

To help address the need for great understanding of {COVID}-19, the scientific community mobilized and banded together rapidly to characterize {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, pathogenesis and its distinct disease trajectories. The urgency of {COVID}-19 provided a pressing use-case for leveraging relatively new tools, technologies, and nascent collaborative networks. Single-cell biology is one such example that has emerged over the last decade as a powerful approach that provides unprecedented resolution to the cellular and molecular underpinnings of biological processes. Early foundational work within the single-cell community, including the Human Cell Atlas, utilized published and unpublished data to characterize the putative target cells of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 sampled from diverse organs based on expression of the viral receptor {ACE2} and associated entry factors {TMPR\SS2} and {CTSL} (Muus et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). This initial characterization of reference data provided an important foundation for framing infection and pathology in the airway as well as other organs. However, initial community analysis was limited to samples derived from uninfected donors and other previously-sampled disease indications. This report provides an overview of a single-cell data resource derived from samples from {COVID}-19 patients along with initial observations and guidance on data reuse and exploration.}

Finding human host factors that are essential for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection could facilitate the formulation of treatment strategies. Using a human kidney cell line-{HK}-2-that is highly susceptible to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, we performed a genome-wide {RNAi} screen and identified virus dependency factors ({VDFs}), which play regulatory roles in biological pathways linked to clinical manifestations of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. We found a role for a secretory form of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ({sACE2}), in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. Further investigation revealed that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 exploits receptor-mediated endocytosis through interaction between its spike with {sACE2} or {sACE2}-vasopressin via {AT1} or {AVPR1B}, respectively. Our identification of {VDFs} and the regulatory effect of {sACE2} on {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection shed insight into pathogenesis and cell entry mechanisms of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 as well as potential treatment strategies for {COVID}-19.

Plasmin, and other host proteases, may cleave the furin site of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein and \gamma subunits of epithelial sodium channels (\gamma {ENaC}), resulting in an increment in virus infectivity and channel activity. As for the importance of {ENaC} in the regulation of airway surface and alveolar fluid homeostasis, whether {SARS}-{CoV}-2 will share and strengthen the cleavage network with {ENaC} proteins at the single-cell level is urgently worthy of consideration. To address this issue, we analyzed single-cell {RNA} sequence ({scRNA}-seq) datasets, and found the {PLAU} (encoding urokinase plasminogen activator), {SCNN1G} ({\gammaENaC}), and {ACE2} ({SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor) were co-expressed in alveolar epithelial, basal, club, and ciliated epithelial cells. The relative expression level of {PLAU}, {TMPR\SS2}, and {ACE2} were significantly upregulated in severe {COVID}-19 patients and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infected cell lines using Seurat and {DESeq2} R packages. Moreover, the increments in {PLAU}, {FURIN}, {TMPR\SS2}, and {ACE2} were predominately observed in different epithelial cells and leukocytes. Accordingly, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 may share and strengthen the {ENaC} fibrinolytic proteases network in {ACE2} positive airway and alveolar epithelial cells, which may expedite virus infusion into the susceptible cells and bring about {ENaC} associated edematous respiratory condition.}

Tissue and cellular tropism is one key to understanding the pathogenesis of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. We investigate the expression and subcellular localization of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), within the upper (nasal) and lower (pulmonary) respiratory tracts of human donors using a diverse panel of banked tissues. Here, we report our discovery that the {ACE2} receptor protein robustly localizes within the motile cilia of airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 viral entry during host respiratory transmission. We further determine whether ciliary {ACE2} expression in the upper airway is influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, or medication use, and show the first mechanistic evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEI}) or angiotensin {II} receptor blockers ({ARBs}) does not increase susceptibility to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection through enhancing the expression of ciliary {ACE2} receptor. These findings are crucial to our understanding of the transmission of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 for prevention and control of this virulent pathogen.}
