Here we have shown in several independent studies that high dose treatment with neutralizing antibody prior to intranasal infection with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus had an antiviral effect in the visceral organs and prolonged survival time of infected mice, even in the absence of alphabeta T cells. Nevertheless, antibody treatment did not prevent the development of lethal encephalitis. On the contrary, the adoptive transfer of primed {CD4}(+) T cells was necessary to prevent lethal encephalitis in mice lacking alphabeta T cell receptor.}

We show that intravenously injected radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the blood-brain barrier in male mice, was taken up by brain regions and entered the parenchymal brain space. I-S1 was also taken up by the lung, spleen, kidney and liver. Intranasally administered I-S1 also entered the brain, although at levels roughly ten times lower than after intravenous administration. {APOE} genotype and sex did not affect whole-brain I-S1 uptake but had variable effects on uptake by the olfactory bulb, liver, spleen and kidney. I-S1 uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb was reduced by lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. Mechanistic studies indicated that I-S1 crosses the blood-brain barrier by adsorptive transcytosis and that murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not in kidney, liver or spleen uptake.}

abstract = {Although {COVID}-19 is considered to be primarily a respiratory disease, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 affects multiple organ systems including the central nervous system ({CNS}). Yet, there is no consensus on the consequences of {CNS} infections. Here, we used three independent approaches to probe the capacity of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to infect the brain. First, using human brain organoids, we observed clear evidence of infection with accompanying metabolic changes in infected and neighboring neurons. However, no evidence for type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented by blocking {ACE2} with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a {COVID}-19 patient. Second, using mice overexpressing human {ACE2}, we demonstrate {SARS}-{CoV}-2 neuroinvasion in vivo. Finally, in autopsies from patients who died of {COVID}-19, we detect {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in cortical neurons and note pathological features associated with infection with minimal immune cell infiltrates. These results provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and an unexpected consequence of direct infection of neurons by {SARS}-{CoV}-2. \copyright 2021 Song et al.}

abstract = {As researchers across the globe have focused their attention on understanding {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the picture that is emerging is that of a virus that has serious effects on the vasculature in multiple organ systems including the cerebral vasculature. Observed effects on the central nervous system include neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells ({hBMVECs}) could be observed. The spike protein, which plays a key role in receptor recognition, is formed by the S1 subunit containing a receptor binding domain ({RBD}) and the S2 subunit. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or {ACE2} (a known binding target for the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike protein), is ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex. Moreover, {ACE2} expression was upregulated in cases of hypertension and dementia. {ACE2} was also detectable in primary {hBMVECs} maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis of cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the {RBD} had minimal effects on {hBMVEC} viability within a 48Â h exposure window. Introduction of spike proteins to invitro models of the blood-brain barrier ({BBB}) showed significant changes to barrier properties. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced {3D} microfluidic model of the human {BBB}, a platform that more closely resembles the physiological conditions at this {CNS} interface. Evidence provided suggests that the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike proteins trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of {BBB} function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in {COVID}-19 patients.

The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews documents that {COVID}-19 has a wide range of common symptoms, which have made it difficult to characterize the disease. To date, the neurological symptoms of stuttering and word-finding difficulties have not been reported in confirmed {COVID}-19 cases. This case report describes the clinical course of a 53-year-old female that presented to the emergency department ({ED}) twice with varying symptoms consistent with {COVID}-19. At the second {ED} visit, she complained of new-onset stuttering and word-finding difficulties and tested positive for {COVID}-19 using the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) nasopharynx test. When contacted, the patient stated that her speech issues persisted at least seven days after discharge from her second {ED} visit. As a result, the virus may cause symptoms of an acute neurological event and should be taken into diagnostic consideration. These neurological findings may be explained by the recent discovery of the {COVID}-19 spike protein's ability to destabilize the blood-brain barrier ({BBB}) and enter the central nervous system ({CNS}). Increased classification of unrecognized {COVID}-19 symptoms and complications may aid in the characterization, surveillance, and prevention of the disease.

abstract = {To elucidate the pathogenesis of eastern equine encephalitis ({EEE}) virus infections, we used histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization to track the spread and early cellular targets of viral infection in mice. Young mice were inoculated with virulent {EEE} virus in their right rear footpad and were followed in a time-course study for 4 days. Virulent {EEE} virus produced a biphasic illness characterized by an early self-limiting replication phase in peripheral tissues followed by an invariably fatal central nervous system ({CNS}) phase. In the early extraneural phase, there was primary amplifying replication of virus within fibroblasts at the inoculation site and within osteoblasts in active growth areas of bone that resulted in a transient high-titer viremia. Pathological changes and viral infection were observed as early as 12 hours post-infection ({PI}) in osteoblasts, skeletal muscle myocytes, and in fibroblasts along fascial sheaths. The severity and extent of infection in peripheral tissues peaked at day 1 {PI}. In the neural phase of infection, virus was first detected in the brain on day 1 {PI}, with rapid interneuronal spread of infection leading to death by day 4 {PI}. {EEE} virus appeared to be directly cytopathic for neurons. The very rapid onset and apparently random and widely dispersed infection in the {CNS}, with concurrent sparing of olfactory neuroepithelium, strongly suggests that invasion of the {CNS} by {EEE} occurs by a vascular route, rather than via peripheral nerves or the olfactory neuroepithelium. Our finding that metaphyseal osteoblasts are an early site of amplifying viral replication may explain the higher-titer viremias and higher incidence of neuroinvasion and fulminant encephalitis seen in the young, and may also explain why mature animals become refractory to encephalitis after peripheral inoculation with {EEE} virus.}

Following footpad infection, both {IFNAR}-1-/- and {IRF}-2-/- mice were more susceptible than control mice to {VEE}. The {IFNAR}-1-/- mice also exhibit accelerated {VEE} dissemination to serum, spleen, and brain, and compared with control mice, they evidenced faster kinetics in the upregulation of proinflammatory genes. In contrast, in {IRF}-2-/- mice, {iNOS} gene induction was completely absent following peripheral virulent {VEE} infection. In evaluating the role of cells involved in {iNOS} production, primary microglial cell cultures were found to be highly permissive to {VEE} infection. Moreover, {VEE} infection increased levels of nitric oxide ({NO}) in resting microglial cultures but decreased {NO} production in {IFN}-gamma-stimulated microglia. Thus, these findings suggest that reactive nitrogen species play an important contributory role in {VEE} dissemination and survival of the host. Our results further suggest the necessity for a carefully balanced host response that follows a middle course between immunopathology and insufficient inflammatory response to {VEE} infection.}

abstract = {Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus ({VEE}) causes a biphasic disease in mice following subcutaneous inoculation in the footpad. In the initial phase, virus replicates primarily in the lymphoid tissues and induces a high titer viremia. Subsequently, the virus invades the central nervous system ({CNS}) from the circulation, and an encephalitis ensues. At the earliest times that {VEE} specific in situ hybridization signal was observed in the {CNS}, it was in areas of the brain involved in olfaction, leading to the hypothesis that virus may invade the brain from the circulation through the olfactory system. The results presented in this paper define the route of {CNS} invasion in experimental murine {VEE} disease initiated by subcutaneous inoculation. Virus circulating in the blood appears to seed specific areas of the peripheral nervous system during the viremic lymphoid phase of the illness. Virus replication within olfactory and dental tissues is followed by centripetal spread of virus along neural pathways. Virus enters the brain in a pattern reflecting the proximity of the peripheral invasion site to the {CNS}. Specifically, virus is first found in the brain within the structures of the olfactory system, followed by areas innervated by the trigeminal nerve. Virus later disseminates along fiber tracts and connected circuits within the brain, resulting in a disseminated meningoencephalitis. Surgical or chemical interruption of the olfactory system at the level of the olfactory neuroepithelium or the main olfactory bulb inhibited entry of {VEE} into the {CNS} through the olfactory nerve. However, the olfactory route is not absolutely required for {CNS} invasion, as virus invaded the {CNS} of olfactory ablated animals through the trigeminal nerve. These observations are consistent with a model of hematogenous seeding of the peripheral nervous system, followed by invasion of the {CNS} by direct neural spread.}

abstract = {Central Nervous System ({CNS}) infections are one of the most critical problems in public health, as frequently patients exhibit neurologic sequelae. Usually, {CNS} pathologies are caused by known neurotropic viruses such as measles virus ({MV}), herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}), among others. However, nowadays respiratory viruses have placed themselves as relevant agents responsible for {CNS} pathologies. Among these neuropathological viruses are the human respiratory syncytial virus ({hRSV}), the influenza virus ({IV}), the coronavirus ({CoV}) and the human metapneumovirus ({hMPV}). These viral agents are leading causes of acute respiratory infections every year affecting mainly children under 5 years old and also the elderly. Up to date, several reports have described the association between respiratory viral infections with neurological symptoms. The most frequent clinical manifestations described in these patients are febrile or afebrile seizures, status epilepticus, encephalopathies and encephalitis. All these viruses have been found in cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}), which suggests that all these pathogens, once in the lungs, can spread throughout the body and eventually reach the {CNS}. The current knowledge about the mechanisms and routes used by these neuro-invasive viruses remains scarce. In this review article, we describe the most recent findings associated to neurologic complications, along with data about the possible invasion routes of these viruses in humans and their various effects on the {CNS}, as studied in animal models.}

abstract = {Endemic and pandemic viral respiratory infections have recently emerged as a critical topic of investigation given the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 outbreak. Data from such outbreaks indicate that severe systemic comorbidities including acute neurologic illness are associated with illness and lead to significant outcome differences. Herein, we will discuss the neurologic manifestations of severe viral respiratory infections including coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus. Data Sources: {PubMed} and {EMBASE} were searched by two independent investigators up to March 2020. Study Selection: Data selection included preclinical and clinical studies detailing neurologic manifestations of viral respiratory infections. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent investigators reviewed and extracted the data. Conclusions: Neurologic manifestations including seizures, status epilepticus, encephalitis, critical illness neuromyopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute necrotizing encephalitis, Guillan-BarrÃ© syndrome, transverse myelitis, and acute flaccid myelitis have all been associated with severe viral respiratory infections. Having an understanding of the direct neurotropism of such viruses is imperative to understanding pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and potential treatment paradigms aimed at improving morbidity and mortality.

abstract = {A new strain of human coronaviruses ({hCoVs}), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), has been identified to be responsible for the current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19). Though major symptoms are primarily generated from the respiratory system, neurological symptoms are being reported in some of the confirmed cases, raising concerns of its potential for intracranial invasion and neurological manifestations, both in the acute phase and in the long-term. At present, it remains unclear the extent to which {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is present in the brain, and if so, its pathogenic role in the central nervous system ({CNS}). Evidence for neuroinvasion and neurovirulence of {hCoVs} has been recognised in animal and human studies. Given that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 belongs to the same family and shares characteristics in terms of receptor binding properties, it is worthwhile exploring its potential {CNS} manifestations. This review summarises previous findings from {hCoVs} in relation to the {CNS}, and compares these with the new strain, aiming to provide a better understanding of the effects of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 on the {CNS}.
