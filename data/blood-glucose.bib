abstract = {Gas exchange in the lung occurs within alveoli, air-filled sacs composed of type 2 and type 1 epithelial cells ({AEC2s} and {AEC1s}), capillaries, and various resident mesenchymal cells. Here, we use a combination of in vivo clonal lineage analysis, different injury/repair systems, and in vitro culture of purified cell populations to obtain new information about the contribution of {AEC2s} to alveolar maintenance and repair. Genetic lineage-tracing experiments showed that surfactant protein C-positive ({SFTPC}-positive) {AEC2s} self renew and differentiate over about a year, consistent with the population containing long-term alveolar stem cells. Moreover, if many {AEC2s} were specifically ablated, high-resolution imaging of intact lungs showed that individual survivors undergo rapid clonal expansion and daughter cell dispersal. Individual lineage-labeled {AEC2s} placed into {3D} culture gave rise to self-renewing "alveolospheres," which contained both {AEC2s} and cells expressing multiple {AEC1} markers, including {HOPX}, a new marker for {AEC1s}. Growth and differentiation of the alveolospheres occurred most readily when cocultured with primary {PDGFR\alpha}⁺ lung stromal cells. This population included lipofibroblasts that normally reside close to {AEC2s} and may therefore contribute to a stem cell niche in the murine lung. Results suggest that a similar dynamic exists between {AEC2s} and mesenchymal cells in the human lung.}

abstract = {The average lifespan of humans is increasing, and with it the percentage of people entering the 65 and older age group is growing rapidly and will continue to do so in the next 20 years. Within this age group, cardiovascular disease will remain the leading cause of death, and the cost associated with treatment will continue to increase. Aging is an inevitable part of life and unfortunately poses the largest risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although numerous studies in the cardiovascular field have considered both young and aged humans, there are still many unanswered questions as to how the genetic pathways that regulate aging in model organisms influence cardiovascular aging. Likewise, in the molecular biology of aging field, few studies fully assess the role of these aging pathways in cardiovascular health. Fortunately, this gap is beginning to close, and these two fields are merging together. We provide an overview of some of the key genes involved in regulating lifespan and health span, including sirtuins, {AMP}-activated protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 and their roles regulating cardiovascular health. We then discuss a series of review articles that will appear in succession and provide a more comprehensive analysis of studies carried out linking genes of aging and cardiovascular health, and perspectives of future directions of these two intimately linked fields.}

abstract = {Epithelial cells provide an initial line of defense against damage and pathogens in barrier tissues such as the skin; however this balance is disrupted in obesity and metabolic disease. Skin gammadelta T cells recognize epithelial damage, and release cytokines and growth factors that facilitate wound repair. We report here that hyperglycemia results in impaired skin gammadelta T cell proliferation due to altered {STAT5} signaling, ultimately resulting in half the number of gammadelta T cells populating the epidermis. Skin gammadelta T cells that overcome this hyperglycemic state are unresponsive to epithelial cell damage due to chronic inflammatory mediators, including {TNFalpha}. Cytokine and growth factor production at the site of tissue damage was partially restored by administering neutralizing {TNFalpha} antibodies in vivo. Thus, metabolic disease negatively impacts homeostasis and functionality of skin gammadelta T cells, rendering host defense mechanisms vulnerable to injury and infection.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many details in cell culture-derived influenza vaccine production are still poorly understood and approaches for process optimization mainly remain empirical. More insights on mammalian cell metabolism after a viral infection could give hints on limitations and cell-specific virus production capacities. A detailed metabolic characterization of an influenza infected adherent cell line ({MDCK}) was carried out based on extracellular and intracellular measurements of metabolite concentrations. {RESULTS}: For most metabolites the comparison of infected (human influenza A/{PR}/8/34) and mock-infected cells showed a very similar behavior during the first 10-12 h post infection (pi). Significant changes were observed after about 12 h pi: (1) uptake of extracellular glucose and lactate release into the cell culture supernatant were clearly increased in infected cells compared to mock-infected cells. At the same time (12 h pi) intracellular metabolite concentrations of the upper part of glycolysis were significantly increased. On the contrary, nucleoside triphosphate concentrations of infected cells dropped clearly after 12 h pi. This behaviour was observed for two different human influenza A/{PR}/8/34 strains at slightly different time points. {CONCLUSIONS}: Comparing these results with literature values for the time course of infection with same influenza strains, underline the hypothesis that influenza infection only represents a minor additional burden for host cell metabolism. The metabolic changes observed after 12 h pi are most probably caused by the onset of apoptosis in infected cells. The comparison of experimental data from two variants of the A/{PR}/8/34 virus strain ({RKI} versus {NIBSC}) with different productivities and infection dynamics showed comparable metabolic patterns but a clearly different timely behavior. Thus, infection dynamics are obviously reflected in host cell metabolism.}

The molecular mechanisms of {AngII} pathophysiological activity involve the stimulation of {NADPH} oxidases, which produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. {AngII} also increases the production of mitochondrial {ROS}, while the inhibition of {AngII} improves mitochondrial function; however, the specific molecular mechanisms of the stimulation of mitochondrial {ROS} is not clear. {RECENT} {ADVANCES}: Interestingly, the overexpression of mitochondrial thioredoxin 2 or mitochondrial superoxide dismutase attenuates {AngII}-induced hypertension, which demonstrates the importance of mitochondrial {ROS} in {AngII}-mediated cardiovascular diseases. {CRITICAL} {I\SSUES}: Although mitochondrial {ROS} plays an important role in normal physiological cell signaling, {AngII}, high glucose, high fat, or hypoxia may cause the overproduction of mitochondrial {ROS}, leading to the feed-forward redox stimulation of {NADPH} oxidases. This vicious cycle may contribute to the development of pathological conditions and facilitate organ damage in hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. {FUTURE} {DIRECTIONS}: The development of antioxidant strategies specifically targeting mitochondria could be therapeutically beneficial in these disease conditions.}

We assessed the prevalence of glucose abnormalities in a population of patients with essential hypertension. {METHODS}: In this cross-sectional study, 420 consecutively referred essential hypertensive patients were studied at 16 hypertension clinics in university and community hospitals of Spain. Fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose and insulin levels were determined in nondiabetic patients. {RESULTS}: An abnormal glucose metabolism was diagnosed in 68.5\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 63.7\%-72.9\%) of the patients. Isolated insulin resistance, defined by a homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance ({HOMA}-{IR}) equal to or above 3.8, was shown in 9.3\% (95\% {CI}, 6.7\%-12.5\%); impaired fasting glucose in 11.2\% (95\% {CI}, 8.6\%-14.7\%); impaired glucose tolerance in 22.5\% (95\% {CI}, 18.5\%-26.9\%); silent undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in 11.5\% (95\% {CI}, 8.6\%-14.5\%); and known diabetes mellitus in 13.9\% (95\% {CI}, 10.4\%-17.2\%) of the patients. According to the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance and the Adult Treatment Program {III} criteria, the metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 41.5\% (95\% {CI}, 35.9\%-47.3\%) and 47.9\% (95\% {CI}, 43.1\%-52.8\%) of the patients, respectively. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (defined by a left ventricular mass index [{LVMI}] \textgreater125 g/m2 was 44.2\%. The relation between {HOMA}-{IR} and {LVMI} was statistically nonsignificant, and the {LVMI} values in the {HOMA}-{IR} quartiles were similar. Only 27 patients (6.4\%) showed good control of cardiovascular risk factors. In most patients (273, 65\%; 95\% {CI}, 60.3\%-69.4\%) 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors were identified as not being under control. {CONCLUSIONS}: Two thirds of the patients attending hypertension clinics with essential hypertension show an abnormal glucose metabolism. The metabolic syndrome can be identified in a substantial number of these patients, and 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors are not controlled in the majority of patients.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease. {METHODS}: We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the {CALIBER} ({CArdiovascular} research using {LInked} Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1·25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. This study is registered at {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT01164371}. {FINDINGS}: During 5·2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83,098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90-114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60-74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1·44 [95\% {CI} 1·32-1·58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1·43 [1·25-1·63]), and stable angina (1·41 [1·36-1·46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1·08 [1·00-1·17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm ({HR} per 10 mm Hg 0·91 [95\% {CI} 0·86-0·98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1·23 [1·20-1·27]). People with hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63·3\% (95\% {CI} 62·9-63·8) compared with 46·1\% (45·5-46·8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5·0 years earlier (95\% {CI} 4·8-5·2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43\%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19\% each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years. {INTERPRETATION}: The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them. {FUNDING}: Medical Research Council, National Institute for Health Research, and Wellcome Trust.

abstract = {N-linked oligosaccharides arise when blocks of 14 sugars are added cotranslationally to newly synthesized polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}). These glycans are then subjected to extensive modification as the glycoproteins mature and move through the {ER} via the Golgi complex to their final destinations inside and outside the cell. In the {ER} and in the early secretory pathway, where the repertoire of oligosaccharide structures is still rather small, the glycans play a pivotal role in protein folding, oligomerization, quality control, sorting, and transport. They are used as universal "tags" that allow specific lectins and modifying enzymes to establish order among the diversity of maturing glycoproteins. In the Golgi complex, the glycans acquire more complex structures and a new set of functions. The division of synthesis and processing between the {ER} and the Golgi complex represents an evolutionary adaptation that allows efficient exploitation of the potential of oligosaccharides.}

abstract = {Type I interferons ({IFNs}) are important for host defense from viral infections, acting to restrict viral production in infected cells and to promote antiviral immune responses. However, the type I {IFN} system has also been associated with severe lung inflammatory disease in response to respiratory syncytial virus ({RSV}). Which cells produce type I {IFNs} upon {RSV} infection and how this directs immune responses to the virus, and potentially results in pathological inflammation, is unclear. Here, we show that alveolar macrophages ({AMs}) are the major source of type I {IFNs} upon {RSV} infection in mice. {AMs} detect {RSV} via mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein ({MAVS})-coupled retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 ({RIG}-I)-like receptors ({RLRs}), and loss of {MAVS} greatly compromises innate immune restriction of {RSV}. This is largely attributable to loss of type I {IFN}-dependent induction of monocyte chemoattractants and subsequent reduced recruitment of inflammatory monocytes ({infMo}) to the lungs. Notably, the latter have potent antiviral activity and are essential to control infection and lessen disease severity. Thus, {infMo} recruitment constitutes an important and hitherto underappreciated, cell-extrinsic mechanism of type I {IFN}-mediated antiviral activity. Dysregulation of this system of host antiviral defense may underlie the development of {RSV}-induced severe lung inflammation. \copyright 2015 Goritzka et al.}

Additionally, {SB}-203580 blocked the increase in endothelial permeability and the number of surface openings and caveolae. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that {ANG} {II} plays a role in regulation of permeability and formation of cell surface openings through {AT1} receptor and {PV}-1 protein synthesis in a p38 {MAP} kinase-dependent manner in endothelial cells. The surface openings that increase in parallel with permeability may represent transcellular channels, caveolae, or both.

On admission, patients were randomly assigned to strict normalization of blood glucose levels (80 to 110 mg per deciliter [4.4 to 6.1 mmol per liter]) with the use of insulin infusion or to conventional therapy (insulin administered when the blood glucose level exceeded 215 mg per deciliter [12 mmol per liter], with the infusion tapered when the level fell below 180 mg per deciliter [10 mmol per liter]). There was a history of diabetes in 16.9 percent of the patients. {RESULTS}: In the intention-to-treat analysis of 1200 patients, intensive insulin therapy reduced blood glucose levels but did not significantly reduce in-hospital mortality (40.0 percent in the conventional-treatment group vs. 37.3 percent in the intensive-treatment group, P=0.33).

abstract = {The pulmonary airways are continuously exposed to bacteria. As a first line of defense against infection, the airway surface liquid ({ASL}) contains a complex mixture of antimicrobial factors that kill inhaled and aspirated bacteria. The composition of {ASL} is critical for antimicrobial effectiveness. For example, in cystic fibrosis an abnormally acidic {ASL} inhibits antimicrobial activity. Here, we tested the effect of {pH} on the activity of an {ASL} defensin, human \beta-defensin-3 ({hBD}-3), and the cathelicidin-related peptide, {LL}-37. We found that reducing {pH} from 8.0 to 6.8 reduced the ability of both peptides to kill Staphylococcus aureus. An acidic {pH} also attenuated {LL}-37 killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, we discovered synergism between {hBD}-3 and {LL}-37 in killing S. aureus. {LL}-37 and lysozyme were also synergistic. Importantly, an acidic {pH} reduced the synergistic effects of combinations of {ASL} antibacterials. These results indicate that an acidic {pH} reduces the activity of individual {ASL} antimicrobials, impairs synergism between them, and thus may disrupt an important airway host defense mechanism.}

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis ({CF}) is a life-shortening disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) gene. Although bacterial lung infection and the resulting inflammation cause most of the morbidity and mortality, how the loss of {CFTR} function first disrupts airway host defence has remained uncertain. To investigate the abnormalities that impair elimination when a bacterium lands on the pristine surface of a newborn {CF} airway, we interrogated the viability of individual bacteria immobilized on solid grids and placed onto the airway surface. As a model, we studied {CF} pigs, which spontaneously develop hallmark features of {CF} lung disease. At birth, their lungs lack infection and inflammation, but have a reduced ability to eradicate bacteria. Here we show that in newborn wild-type pigs, the thin layer of airway surface liquid ({ASL}) rapidly kills bacteria in vivo, when removed from the lung and in primary epithelial cultures. Lack of {CFTR} reduces bacterial killing. We found that the {ASL} {pH} was more acidic in {CF} pigs, and reducing {pH} inhibited the antimicrobial activity of {ASL}. Reducing {ASL} {pH} diminished bacterial killing in wild-type pigs, and, conversely, increasing {ASL} {pH} rescued killing in {CF} pigs. These results directly link the initial host defence defect to the loss of {CFTR}, an anion channel that facilitates {HCO}(3)(-) transport. Without {CFTR}, airway epithelial {HCO}(3)(-) secretion is defective, the {ASL} {pH} falls and inhibits antimicrobial function, and thereby impairs the killing of bacteria that enter the newborn lung. These findings suggest that increasing {ASL} {pH} might prevent the initial infection in patients with {CF}, and that assaying bacterial killing could report on the benefit of therapeutic interventions.}

We showed previously that peripheral bronchiolar cilia beat at a lower frequency than bronchial cilia, and have now investigated whether they show differences in tolerance to changes in {pH}. Using the image analysis system applied in the previous study, we compared variations in the ciliary beat frequencies ({CBF}) of bronchi and bronchioles sampled from human lung resections at various {pH} in vitro. Application of nonparametric tests (the variance of samples was not similar) indicated that {CBF} was not significantly modified when {pH} was varied between 7.5 and 10.5 for bronchi, and between 5.5 and 10.5 for bronchioles. Reversible and significantly lower {CBF} were observed below {pH} 7.0 for bronchi and below {pH} 5.0 for bronchioles. Extreme {pH} values such as 11.0 or 3.0 were lethal within a few minutes. Thus, respiratory ciliary beating is able to tolerate external {pH} variations between 3.5 and 10.5 without permanent impairment. In addition we found that alkaline {pH} values are more favourable than acidic ones and that bronchiolar ciliated cells are more tolerant to acidic {pH} than bronchial cells.}

The receptor for advanced glycation end products ({RAGE}) is a multiligand receptor that is expressed ubiquitously in the lungs. Engagement of {RAGE} leads to activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including {NF}-{kappaB} and subsequent transcription of several proinflammatory mediators. To determine the role of {RAGE} in the innate immune response to S. pneumoniae pneumonia, {RAGE}-deficient ({RAGE}(-/-)) and wild-type mice were intranasally inoculated with S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae pneumonia resulted in an up-regulation of constitutively present {RAGE} expression in lung tissue, especially in the interalveolar septae. {RAGE}(-/-) mice showed an improved survival, which was accompanied by a lower bacterial load in the lungs at 16 h and a decreased dissemination of the bacteria to blood and spleen at 16 and 48 h after inoculation. {RAGE}(-/-) macrophages showed an improved killing capacity of S. pneumoniae in vitro. Lung inflammation was attenuated in {RAGE}(-/-) mice at 48 h after inoculation, as indicated by histopathology and cytokine/chemokine levels. Neutrophil migration to the lungs was mitigated in the {RAGE}(-/-) mice. In addition, in {RAGE}(-/-) mice, activation of coagulation was diminished. Additional studies examining the effect of {RAGE} deficiency on the early (6-h) inflammatory response to S. pneumoniae did not reveal an early accelerated or enhanced immune response. These data suggest that {RAGE} plays a detrimental role in the host response to S. pneumoniae pneumonia by facilitating the bacterial growth and dissemination and concurrently enhancing the pulmonary inflammatory and procoagulant response.}

abstract = {Diabetic complications include infection and cardiovascular disease. Within the immune system, host-pathogen and regulatory host-host interactions operate through binding of oligosaccharides by C-type lectin. A number of C-type lectins recognise oligosaccharides rich in mannose and fucose - sugars with similar structures to glucose. This raises the possibility that high glucose conditions in diabetes affect protein-oligosaccharide interactions via competitive inhibition. Mannose-binding lectin, soluble {DC}-{SIGN} and {DC}-{SIGNR}, and surfactant protein D, were tested for carbohydrate binding in the presence of glucose concentrations typical of diabetes, via surface plasmon resonance and affinity chromatography. Complement activation assays were performed in high glucose. {DC}-{SIGN} and {DC}-{SIGNR} expression in adipose tissues was examined via immunohistochemistry. High glucose inhibited C-type lectin binding to high-mannose glycoprotein and binding of {DC}-{SIGN} to fucosylated ligand (blood group B) was abrogated in high glucose. Complement activation via the lectin pathway was inhibited in high glucose and also in high trehalose - a nonreducing sugar with glucoside stereochemistry. {DC}-{SIGN} staining was seen on cells with {DC} morphology within omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues. We conclude that high glucose disrupts C-type lectin function, potentially illuminating new perspectives on susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory disease in diabetes. Mechanisms involve competitive inhibition of carbohydrate binding within sets of defined proteins, in contrast to broadly indiscriminate, irreversible glycation of proteins.

The involvement of this protein in innate immunity and the allergic response make it the subject of much interest. {RESULTS}: We have determined the crystal structure of a trimeric fragment of {hSP}-D at 2.3 A resolution. The structure comprises an alpha-helical coiled-coil and three carbohydrate-recognition domains ({CRDs}). An interesting deviation from symmetry was found in the projection of a single tyrosine sidechain into the centre of the coiled-coil; the asymmetry of this residue influences the orientation of one of the adjacent {CRDs}. The cleft between the three {CRDs} presents a large positively charged surface. {CONCLUSIONS}: The fold of the {CRD} of {hSP}-D is similar to that of the mannan-binding protein ({MBP}), but its orientation relative to the alpha-helical coiled-coil region differs somewhat to that seen in the {MBP} structure. The novel central packing of the tyrosine sidechain within the coiled-coil and the resulting asymmetric orientation of the {CRDs} has unexpected functional implications. The positively charged surface might facilitate binding to negatively charged structures, such as lipopolysaccharides.}

The role of redox mechanisms in the central nervous system ({CNS}), a tissue known to be pivotal in Ang {II}-dependent hypertension, has not been investigated. We recently identified superoxide (O2*-) in the brain as a key signaling intermediate in the transient pressor response elicited by acute injection of Ang {II} directly into the {CNS}. Here we tested the hypothesis that hypertension caused by chronic systemic infusion of Ang {II} is mediated by a central neurogenic mechanism involving O2*-. Infusion of Ang {II} (600 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1)) over a 2-week period in mice caused a gradually developing hypertension that was correlated with marked elevations in O2*- production specifically in the subfornical organ ({SFO}), a brain region lying outside the blood-brain barrier and known to be a primary sensor for blood-borne Ang {II}. Adenoviral-mediated delivery of cytoplasmically targeted superoxide dismutase ({SOD}) selectively to this site prevented the hypertension and the increased O2*- production, whereas gene transfer of {SOD} targeted to the extracellular matrix had no effect. These data suggest that increased intracellular O2*- production in the {SFO} is critical in the development of Ang {II}-induced hypertension.}

A near-universal property of primary and metastatic cancers is upregulation of glycolysis, resulting in increased glucose consumption, which can be observed with clinical tumour imaging. We propose that persistent metabolism of glucose to lactate even in aerobic conditions is an adaptation to intermittent hypoxia in pre-malignant lesions. However, upregulation of glycolysis leads to microenvironmental acidosis requiring evolution to phenotypes resistant to acid-induced cell toxicity. Subsequent cell populations with upregulated glycolysis and acid resistance have a powerful growth advantage, which promotes unconstrained proliferation and invasion.}

The number of proteins filed as glycoproteins is however considerably smaller, 7942, of which 749 have been characterized with respect to the total number of their carbohydrate units and sites of attachment of the latter to the protein, as well as the nature of the carbohydrate-peptide linking group. Of these well characterized glycoproteins, about 90\% carry either N-linked carbohydrate units alone or both N- and O-linked ones, attached at 1297 N-glycosylation sites (1.9 per glycoprotein molecule) and the rest are O-glycosylated only. Since the total number of sequons in the well characterized glycoproteins is 1968, their rate of occupancy is 2/3. Assuming that the same number of N-linked units and rate of sequon occupancy occur in all sequon containing proteins and that the proportion of solely O-glycosylated proteins (ca. 10\%) will also be the same as among the well characterized ones, we conclude that the majority of sequon containing proteins will be found to be glycosylated and that more than half of all proteins are glycoproteins.}

abstract = {Aging is a dynamic process in which its rate and subsequent longevity of an organism are dependent upon the balance between the reactive intermediates of normal cellular metabolism and the ability of the body to reduce these by-products through a multifaceted antioxidant defence system. Every disturbance of this balance constitutes a clear and present danger to the macromolecular integrity of the body. When defence mechanisms become diminished or impaired, the resulting imbalance results in accumulation of endogenous agents, such as reactive oxygen and carbonyl species, and a state of increased cellular stress, which can accelerate the rate of aging. Glycation is the non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins, nucleotides and lipids by saccharide derivatives. Glucose and other reducing sugars are important glycating agents, but the most reactive physiological relevant glycating agents, are the dicarbonyls, in particular methylglyoxal. Endogenously formed dicarbonyl compounds can react with proteins to form advanced glycation endproducts ({AGEs}). Experimental models have recently provided evidence that reduced detoxification of {AGE} precursors by the glyoxalase system, engagement of the cellular receptor {RAGE} and {RAGE}-dependent sustained activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor {\kappaB} might significantly contribute to the rate of aging and the onset of age-related neurodegenerative, musculoskeletal and vascular diseases.Copyright \copyright 2010 S.

In humans, glucose concentrations are normally low (\textless1 mmol/l) in nasal and bronchial fluid, but they are elevated by inflammation or hyperglycemia. Furthermore, elevated bronchial glucose is associated with increased respiratory infection in intensive care patients. Our aims were to estimate normal glucose concentrations in fluid from distal human lung sampled noninvasively and to determine effects of hyperglycemia and lung disease on lung glucose concentrations. Respiratory fluid was sampled as exhaled breath condensate, and glucose was measured by chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Dilution corrections, based on conductivity, were applied to estimate respiratory fluid glucose concentrations (breath glucose). We found that breath glucose in healthy volunteers was 0.40 mmol/l ({SD} 0.24), reproducible, and unaffected by changes in salivary glucose. Breath-to-blood glucose ratio ({BBGR}) was 0.08 ({SD} 0.05). Breath glucose increased during experimental hyperglycemia (P \textless 0.05) and was elevated in diabetic patients without lung disease [1.20 mmol/l ({SD} 0.69)] in proportion to hyperglycemia [{BBGR} 0.09 ({SD} 0.06)]. Breath glucose was elevated more than expected for blood glucose in cystic fibrosis patients [breath 2.04 mmol/l ({SD} 1.14), {BBGR} 0.29 ({SD} 0.17)] and in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes [breath 4.00 mmol/l ({SD} 2.07), {BBGR} 0.54 (0.28); P \textless 0.0001]. These data indicate that 1) this method makes a biologically plausible estimate of respiratory fluid glucose concentration, 2) respiratory fluid glucose concentrations are elevated by hyperglycemia and lung disease, and 3) effects of hyperglycemia and lung disease can be distinguished using the {BBGR}. This method will support future in vivo investigation of the cause and effect of elevated respiratory fluid glucose in human lung disease.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in critically ill patients, even if they have not previously had diabetes. Whether the normalization of blood glucose levels with insulin therapy improves the prognosis for such patients is not known. {METHODS}: We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study involving adults admitted to our surgical intensive care unit who were receiving mechanical ventilation. On admission, patients were randomly assigned to receive intensive insulin therapy (maintenance of blood glucose at a level between 80 and 110 mg per deciliter [4.4 and 6.1 mmol per liter]) or conventional treatment (infusion of insulin only if the blood glucose level exceeded 215 mg per deciliter [11.9 mmol per liter] and maintenance of glucose at a level between 180 and 200 mg per deciliter [10.0 and 11.1 mmol per liter]). {RESULTS}: At 12 months, with a total of 1548 patients enrolled, intensive insulin therapy reduced mortality during intensive care from 8.0 percent with conventional treatment to 4.6 percent (P\textless 0.04, with adjustment for sequential analyses). The benefit of intensive insulin therapy was attributable to its effect on mortality among patients who remained in the intensive care unit for more than five days (20.2 percent with conventional treatment, as compared with 10.6 percent with intensive insulin therapy, P=0.005). The greatest reduction in mortality involved deaths due to multiple-organ failure with a proven septic focus. Intensive insulin therapy also reduced overall in-hospital mortality by 34 percent, bloodstream infections by 46 percent, acute renal failure requiring dialysis or hemofiltration by 41 percent, the median number of red-cell transfusions by 50 percent, and critical-illness polyneuropathy by 44 percent, and patients receiving intensive therapy were less likely to require prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care. {CONCLUSIONS}: Intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose at or below 110 mg per deciliter reduces morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients in the surgical intensive care unit.}

abstract = {Hypertension is a complex condition and is the most common cardiovascular risk factor, contributing to widespread morbidity and mortality. Approximately 90\% of hypertension cases are classified as essential hypertension, where the precise cause is unknown. Hypertension is associated with inflammation; however, whether inflammation is a cause or effect of hypertension is not well understood. The purpose of this review is to describe evidence from human and animal studies that inflammation leads to the development of hypertension, as well as the evidence for involvement of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction--both thought to be key steps in the development of hypertension. Other potential proinflammatory conditions that contribute to hypertension-such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, aging, and elevated aldosterone--are also discussed. Finally, we consider the potential benefit of anti-inflammatory drugs and statins for antihypertensive therapy. The evidence reviewed suggests that inflammation can lead to the development of hypertension and that oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are involved in the inflammatory cascade. Aging and aldosterone may also both be involved in inflammation and hypertension. Hence, in the absence of serious side effects, anti-inflammatory drugs could potentially be used to treat hypertension in the future.}

A disturbed balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis has been implicated in the pathogenesis hereof. To determine the selective effects of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on coagulation and fibrinolysis, six healthy humans were studied on four occasions for 6 h: 1) lower insulinemic-euglycemic clamp, 2) lower insulinemic-hyperglycemic clamp, 3) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and 4) hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamp. In the hyperglycemic clamps, target levels of plasma glucose were 12 versus 5 mmol/l in the normoglycemic clamps. In the hyperinsulinemic clamps, target plasma insulin levels were 400 versus 100 pmol/l in the lower insulinemic clamps. Hyperglycemia exerted a procoagulant effect irrespective of insulin levels, as reflected by mean twofold rises in thrombin-antithrombin complexes and soluble tissue factor, whereas hyperinsulinemia inhibited fibrinolysis irrespective of glucose levels, as reflected by a decrease in plasminogen activator activity levels due to a mean 2.5-fold rise in plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. The differential effects of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia suggest that patients with hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance are especially susceptible to thrombotic events by a concurrent insulin-driven impairment of fibrinolysis and a glucose-driven activation of coagulation.}

abstract = {The {HIV}-1-envelope (Env) trimer is covered by a glycan shield of ∼90 N-linked oligosaccharides, which comprises roughly half its mass and is a key component of {HIV} evasion from humoral immunity. To understand how antibodies can overcome the barriers imposed by the glycan shield, we crystallized fully glycosylated Env trimers from clades A, B, and G, visualizing the shield at 3.4-3.7 {\AA} resolution. These structures reveal the {HIV}-1-glycan shield to comprise a network of interlocking oligosaccharides, substantially ordered by glycan crowding, that encase the protein component of Env and enable {HIV}-1 to avoid most antibody-mediated neutralization. The revealed features delineate a taxonomy of N-linked glycan-glycan interactions. Crowded and dispersed glycans are differently ordered, conserved, processed, and recognized by antibody. The structures, along with glycan-array binding and molecular dynamics, reveal a diversity in oligosaccharide affinity and a requirement for accommodating glycans among known broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the glycan-shielded trimer.

abstract = {The hemagglutinin ({HA}) of influenza A({H3N2}) virus responsible for the 1968 influenza pandemic derived from an avian virus. On introduction into humans, its receptor binding properties had changed from a preference for avian receptors (\alpha2,3-linked sialic acid) to a preference for human receptors (\alpha2,6-linked sialic acid). By 2001, the avidity of human H3 viruses for avian receptors had declined, and since then the affinity for human receptors has also decreased significantly. These changes in receptor binding, which correlate with increased difficulties in virus propagation in vitro and in antigenic analysis, have been assessed by virus hemagglutination of erythrocytes from different species and quantified by measuring virus binding to receptor analogs using surface biolayer interferometry. Crystal structures of {HA}-receptor analog complexes formed with {HAs} from viruses isolated in 2004 and 2005 reveal significant differences in the conformation of the 220-loop of {HA1}, relative to the 1968 structure, resulting in altered interactions between the {HA} and the receptor analog that explain the changes in receptor affinity. Site-specific mutagenesis shows the {HA1} Asp-225→Asn substitution to be the key determinant of the decreased receptor binding in viruses circulating since 2005. Our results indicate that the evolution of human influenza A({H3N2}) viruses since 1968 has produced a virus with a low propensity to bind human receptor analogs, and this loss of avidity correlates with the marked reduction in A({H3N2}) virus disease impact in the last 10 y.}

In humans, infection of the lower respiratory tract of can result in flooding of the alveolar compartment, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and death from respiratory failure. Influenza-mediated damage of the airway, alveolar epithelium and alveolar endothelium results from a combination of: 1) intrinsic viral pathogenicity, attributable to its tropism for host airway and alveolar epithelial cells; and 2) a robust host innate immune response, which, while contributing to viral clearance, can worsen the severity of lung injury. In this review, we summarise the molecular events at the virus-host interface during influenza virus infection, highlighting some of the important cellular responses. We discuss immune-mediated viral clearance, the mechanisms promoting or perpetuating lung injury, lung regeneration after influenza-induced injury, and recent advances in influenza prevention and therapy.

Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that elevated glucose (\textgreater6 {mM}) dramatically inhibited S. aureus-initiated complement-mediated immune effectors. Here we report in vivo studies evaluating the extent to which a hyperglycemic environment alters complement-mediated control of S. aureus infection in a rat peritonitis model. Rats were treated with streptozocin to induce diabetes or sham-treated and then inoculated i.p. with S. aureus. Rats were euthanized and had peritoneal lavage at 2 or 24 hours after infection to evaluate early and late complement-mediated effects. Hyperglycemia decreased the influx of {IgG} and complement components into the peritoneum in response to S. aureus infection and decreased anaphylatoxin generation. Hyperglycemia decreased C4-fragment and C3-fragment opsonization of S. aureus recovered in peritoneal fluids, compared with euglycemic or insulin-rescued rats. Hyperglycemic rats showed decreased phagocytosis efficiency compared with euglycemic rats, which correlated inversely with bacterial survival. These results suggest that hyperglycemia inhibited humoral effector recruitment, anaphylatoxin generation, and complement-mediated opsonization of S. aureus, suggesting that hyperglycemic inhibition of complement effectors may contribute to the increased risk and severity of S. aureus infections in diabetic patients.}

In animals and humans, {RAAS} intrinsic to tissues modulates food intake, metabolic rate, adiposity, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. A large array of observations shows that dysregulation of {RAAS} in the metabolic syndrome favors type 2 diabetes. Remarkably, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, suppressing the synthesis of angiotensin {II} ({ANG} {II}), and angiotensin receptor blockers, targeting the {ANG} {II} type 1 receptor, prevent diabetes in patients with hypertensive or ischemic cardiopathy. These drugs interrupt the negative feedback loop of {ANG} {II} on the {RAAS} cascade, which results in increased production of angiotensins. In addition, they change the tissue expression of {RAAS} components. Therefore, the concept of a dual axis of {RAAS} regarding glucose homeostasis has emerged. The {RAAS} deleterious axis increases the production of inflammatory cytokines and raises oxidative stress, exacerbating the insulin resistance and decreasing insulin secretion. The beneficial axis promotes adipogenesis, blocks the production of inflammatory cytokines, and lowers oxidative stress, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and secretion. Currently, drugs targeting {RAAS} are not given for the purpose of preventing diabetes in humans. However, we anticipate that in the near future the discovery of novel means to modulate the {RAAS} beneficial axis will result in a decisive therapeutic breakthrough.

In this study, we found that we could control influenza infection of mammalian cells by altering the level of glucose given to cells. Higher glucose concentrations induced a dose-specific increase in influenza infection. Linking influenza virus infection with glycolysis, we found that viral replication was significantly reduced after cells were treated with glycolytic inhibitors. Addition of extracellular {ATP} after glycolytic inhibition restored influenza infection. We also determined that higher levels of glucose promoted the assembly of the vacuolar-type {ATPase} within cells, and increased vacuolar-type {ATPase} proton-transport activity. The increase of viral infection via high glucose levels could be reversed by inhibition of the proton pump, linking glucose metabolism, vacuolar-type {ATPase} activity, and influenza viral infection. Taken together, we propose that altering glucose metabolism may be a potential new approach to inhibit influenza viral infection. Copyright \copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a growing problem in all parts of the world. Both clinical trials and animal models of type I and type {II} diabetes have shown that hyperactivity of angiotensin-{II} (Ang-{II}) signaling pathways contribute to the development of diabetes and diabetic complications. Of clinical relevance, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system prevents new-onset diabetes and reduces the risk of diabetic complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) 2 is a recently discovered mono-carboxypeptidase and the first homolog of {ACE}. It is thought to inhibit Ang-{II} signaling cascades mostly by cleaving Ang-{II} to generate Ang-(1-7), which effects oppose Ang-{II} and are mediated by the Mas receptor. The enzyme is present in the kidney, liver, adipose tissue and pancreas. Its expression is elevated in the endocrine pancreas in diabetes and in the early phase during diabetic nephropathy. {ACE2} is hypothesized to act in a compensatory manner in both diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Recently, we have shown the presence of the Mas receptor in the mouse pancreas and observed a reduction in Mas receptor immuno-reactivity as well as higher fasting blood glucose levels in {ACE2} knockout mice, indicating that these mice may be a new model to study the role of {ACE2} in diabetes. In this review we will examine the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the physiopathology and treatment of diabetes and highlight the potential benefits of the {ACE2}/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis, focusing on recent data about {ACE2}.}

Four main molecular mechanisms have been implicated in glucose-mediated vascular damage. All seem to reflect a single hyperglycaemia-induced process of overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. This integrating paradigm provides a new conceptual framework for future research and drug discovery.}

abstract = {The lung interfaces with the environment across a continuous epithelium composed of various cell types along the proximal and distal airways. At the alveolar structure level, the epithelium, which is composed of type I and type {II} alveolar epithelial cells, represents a critical component of lung homeostasis. Indeed, its fundamental role is to provide an extensive surface for gas exchange. Additional functions that act to preserve the capacity for such unique gas transfer have been progressively identified. The alveolar epithelium represents a physical barrier that protects from environmental insults by segregating inhaled foreign agents and regulating water and ions transport, thereby contributing to the maintenance of alveolar surface fluid balance. The homeostatic role of alveolar epithelium relies on the regulated/controlled production of the pulmonary surfactant, which is not only a key determinant of alveolar mechanical stability but also a complex structure that participates in the cross-talk between local cells and the lung immune and inflammatory response. In regard to these critical functions, a major point is the maintenance of alveolar surface integrity, which relies on the renewal capacity of type {II} alveolar epithelial cells, and the contribution of progenitor populations within the lung.

abstract = {Angiotensin {II} ({AngII}), the major effector peptide of renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}), is now recognized as a growth factor that regulates cell growth and fibrosis, besides being a physiological mediator restoring circulatory integrity. In the last few years, a large number of experimental studies has further demonstrated that {AngII} is involved in key events of the inflammatory process. Here, we summarize the wide variety of {AngII} functions and discuss them in relation with the inflammatory cascade. {AngII} increases vascular permeability (via the release of prostaglandins and vascular endothelial cell growth factor or rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins) that initiates the inflammatory process. {AngII} could contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the tissue through the regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines by resident cells. Moreover, {AngII} could directly activate infiltrating immunocompetent cells, including chemotaxis, differentiation and proliferation. Recent data also suggest that {RAS} activation could play a certain role even in immunologically-induced inflammation. Transcriptional regulation, predominantly via nuclear factor-{kappaB} ({NF}-{kappaB}) and {AP}-1 activation, and second mediator systems, such as endothelin-1, the small G protein (Rho) and redox-pathways are shown to be involved in the molecular mechanism by which {AngII} exerts those functions. Finally, {AngII} participates in tissue repair and remodeling, through the regulation of cell growth and matrix synthesis. In summary, recent data support the hypothesis that {RAS} is key mediator of inflammation. Further understanding of the role of the {RAS} in this process may provide important opportunities for clinical research and treatment of inflammatory diseases.}

Metformin, a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes, is the only drug demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. However, whether metformin can effectively prevent thrombosis and its potential mechanism of action is unknown. Here we show, metformin prevents both venous and arterial thrombosis with no significant prolonged bleeding time by inhibiting platelet activation and extracellular mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA}) release. Specifically, metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I and thereby protects mitochondrial function, reduces activated platelet-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization, reactive oxygen species overload and associated membrane damage. In mitochondrial function assays designed to detect amounts of extracellular {mtDNA}, we found that metformin prevents {mtDNA} release. This study also demonstrated that {mtDNA} induces platelet activation through a {DC}-{SIGN} dependent pathway. Metformin exemplifies a promising new class of antiplatelet agents that are highly effective at inhibiting platelet activation by decreasing the release of free {mtDNA}, which induces platelet activation in a {DC}-{SIGN}-dependent manner. This study has established a novel therapeutic strategy and molecular target for thrombotic diseases, especially for thrombotic complications of diabetes mellitus.}

In health this clearance mechanism is effective, but in patients with primary cilia dyskinesia ({PCD}) the cilia are abnormal, resulting in deficient {MCC} and chronic lung disease.

Just as the heat capacity (C) of a house minimizes sudden temperature (T) shifts caused by acute cold and heat loads, the buffering power (beta) of a cell minimizes sudden {pH}(i) shifts caused by acute acid and alkali loads. However, increasing C (or beta) only minimizes T (or {pH}(i)) changes; it does not eliminate the changes, return T (or {pH}(i)) to normal, or shift steady-state T (or {pH}(i)). Whereas a house may have a furnace to raise T, a cell generally has more than one acid-extruding transporter (which exports acid and/or imports alkali) to raise {pH}(i). Whereas an air conditioner lowers T, a cell generally has more than one acid-loading transporter to lower {pH}(i). Just as a house might respond to graded decreases (or increases) in T by producing graded increases in heat (or cold) output, cells respond to graded decreases (or increases) in {pH}(i) with graded increases (or decreases) in acid-extrusion (or acid-loading) rate. Steady-state T (or {pH}(i)) can change only in response to a change in chronic cold (or acid) loading or chronic heat (or alkali) loading as produced, for example, by a change in environmental T (or {pH}) or a change in the kinetics of the furnace (or acid extrudes) or air conditioner (or acid loaders). Finally, just as a temperature-control system might benefit from environmental sensors that provide clues about cold and heat loading, at least some cells seem to have extracellular {CO}(2) or extracellular {HCO}(3)(-) sensors that modulate acid-base transport.}

Protein glycation and formation of advanced glycation end products ({AGEs}) play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiomyopathy along with some other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and aging. Glycation of proteins interferes with their normal functions by disrupting molecular conformation, altering enzymatic activity, and interfering with receptor functioning. {AGEs} form intra- and extracellular cross linking not only with proteins, but with some other endogenous key molecules including lipids and nucleic acids to contribute in the development of diabetic complications. Recent studies suggest that {AGEs} interact with plasma membrane localized receptors for {AGEs} ({RAGE}) to alter intracellular signaling, gene expression, release of pro-inflammatory molecules and free radicals. The present review discusses the glycation of plasma proteins such as albumin, fibrinogen, globulins and collagen to form different types of {AGEs}. Furthermore, the role of {AGEs} in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications including retinopathy, cataract, neuropathy, nephropathy and cardiomyopathy is also discussed.}

The subjects were divided into the following groups: (1) healthy (n 5 79, 18-94 years, 50 men) and (2) {DM} and/or {HTN}, of which 37 had {DM} (14-90 years, 12 men), 52 had {HTN} (23-90 years, 12 men), and 84 had both {DM} and {HTN} (25-82 years, 33 men). Subjects were also grouped by age: , 40 years, 40 to 59 years, and 60 years. We assessed demographic and clinical data, quality of life using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ({SF}-36) questionnaire, nasal mucociliary clearance using the saccharine transit test ({STT}), and in vitro mucus properties by examining the sneeze (high airflow) clearability and contact angle. A logistic regression analysis for prolonged {STT} . 12 min was used, and we controlled for age, sex, and diseases. {RESULTS}: Subjects aged . 60 years reported a decreased {SF}-36 physical component relative to other age groups. Sex, {BMI}, {BP}, heart rate, pulse oximetry, blood glucose level, and mucus properties were not associated with prolonged {STT}. Aging and {DM} and/or {HTN} independently increased the risk of prolonged {STT}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Aging and {DM}, {HTN}, or both diseases are independently associated with decreased nasal mucociliary clearance.

abstract = {In gas exchangers, the tissue barrier, the partition that separates the respiratory media (water/air and hemolymph/blood), is exceptional for its remarkable thinness, striking strength, and vast surface area. These properties formed to meet conflicting roles: thinness was essential for efficient flux of oxygen by passive diffusion, and strength was crucial for maintaining structural integrity. What we have designated as "three-ply" or "laminated tripartite" architecture of the barrier appeared very early in the evolution of the vertebrate gas exchanger. The design is conspicuous in the water-blood barrier of the fish gills through the lungs of air-breathing vertebrates, where the plan first appeared in lungfishes (Dipnoi) some 400 million years ago. The similarity of the structural design of the barrier in respiratory organs of animals that remarkably differ phylogenetically, behaviorally, and ecologically shows that the construction has been highly conserved both vertically and horizontally, i.e., along and across the evolutionary continuum. It is conceivable that the blueprint may have been the only practical construction that could simultaneously grant satisfactory strength and promote gas exchange. In view of the very narrow allometric range of the thickness of the blood-gas barrier in the lungs of different-sized vertebrate groups, the measurement has seemingly been optimized. There is convincing, though indirect, evidence that the extracellular matrix and particularly the type {IV} collagen in the lamina densa of the basement membrane is the main stress-bearing component of the blood-gas barrier. Under extreme conditions of operation and in some disease states, the barrier fails with serious consequences. The lamina densa which in many parts of the blood-gas barrier is \textless 50 nm thin is a lifeline in the true sense of the word.}

The altered glucose homeostasis is caused by faulty signal transduction via the insulin signaling proteins, which results in decreased glucose uptake by the muscle, altered lipogenesis, and increased glucose output by the liver. The etiology of this derangement in insulin signaling is related to a chronic inflammatory state, leading to the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and release of high levels of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species, which together cause posttranslational modifications in the signaling proteins. There are substantial differences in the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in muscle versus liver. Hormones and cytokines from adipocytes can enhance or inhibit both glycemic sensing and insulin signaling. The role of the central nervous system in glucose homeostasis also has been established. Multipronged therapies aimed at rectifying obesity-induced anomalies in both central nervous system and peripheral tissues may prove to be beneficial.}

abstract = {Tuberculosis ({TB}) remains one of the greatest threats to human health. The causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is acquired by the respiratory route. It is exquisitely human adapted and a prototypic intracellular pathogen of macrophages, with alveolar macrophages ({AMs}) being the primary conduit of infection and disease. The outcome of primary infection is most often a latently infected healthy human host, in whom the bacteria are held in check by the host immune response. Such individuals can develop active {TB} later in life with impairment in the immune system. In contrast, in a minority of infected individuals, the host immune response fails to control the growth of bacilli, and progressive granulomatous disease develops, facilitating spread of the bacilli via infectious aerosols coughed out into the environment and inhaled by new hosts. The molecular details of the Mtb-macrophage interaction continue to be elucidated. However, it is clear that a number of complex processes are involved at the different stages of infection that may benefit either the bacterium or the host. Macrophages demonstrate tremendous phenotypic heterogeneity and functional plasticity which, depending on the site and stage of infection, facilitate the diverse outcomes. Moreover, host responses vary depending on the specific characteristics of the infecting Mtb strain. In this chapter, we describe a contemporary view of the behavior of {AMs} and their interaction with various Mtb strains in generating unique immunologic lung-specific responses.}

abstract = {To ensure optimal environments for their replication and spread, viruses have evolved to alter many host cell pathways. In the last decade, metabolomic studies have shown that eukaryotic viruses induce large-scale alterations in host cellular metabolism. Most viruses examined to date induce aerobic glycolysis also known as the Warburg effect. Many viruses tested also induce fatty acid synthesis as well as glutaminolysis. These modifications of carbon source utilization by infected cells can increase available energy for virus replication and virion production, provide specific cellular substrates for virus particles and create viral replication niches while increasing infected cell survival. Each virus species also likely requires unique metabolic changes for successful spread and recent research has identified additional virus-specific metabolic changes induced by many virus species. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations required for the replication of each virus may lead to novel therapeutic approaches through targeted inhibition of specific cellular metabolic pathways.

The "compositional" hypothesis predicts that {ASL} [{NaCl}] is kept low (\textless 50 {mM}) by passive forces to permit antimicrobial factors to act as a chemical defense. The "volume" hypothesis predicts that {ASL} volume (height) is regulated isotonically by active ion transport to maintain efficient mechanical mucus clearance as the primary form of lung defense. To compare these hypotheses, we searched for roles for: (1) passive forces (surface tension, ciliary tip capillarity, Donnan, and nonionic osmolytes) in the regulation of {ASL} composition; and (2) active ion transport in {ASL} volume regulation. In primary human tracheobronchial cultures, we found no evidence that a low [{NaCl}] {ASL} could be produced by passive forces, or that nonionic osmolytes contributed substantially to {ASL} osmolality. Instead, we found that active ion transport regulated {ASL} volume (height), and that feedback existed between the {ASL} and airway epithelia to govern the rate of ion transport and volume absorption. The mucus layer acted as a "reservoir" to buffer periciliary liquid layer height (7 microm) at a level optimal for mucus transport by donating or accepting liquid to or from the periciliary liquid layer, respectively. These data favor the active ion transport/volume model hypothesis to describe {ASL} physiology.}

Forty-five subjects were randomly assigned to the interventional weight loss ({VLCK} diet), and 44 to the standard low-calorie diet. {RESULTS}: No significant differences in the laboratory safety parameters were found between the two study groups. Changes in the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in {VLCK} diet were not significant and were comparable to control group. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen did not change significantly relative to baseline nor between groups. Weight loss and reduction in waist circumference in the {VLCK} diet group were significantly larger than in control subjects (both P\textless 0.001). The decline in {HbA1c} and glycemic control was larger in the {VLCK} diet group (P\textless 0.05).

abstract = {Glycans are carbohydrate modifications typically found on proteins or lipids, and can act as ligands for glycan-binding proteins called lectins. Glycans and lectins play crucial roles in the function of cells and organs, and in the immune system of animals and humans. Viral pathogens use glycans and lectins that are encoded by their own or the host genome for their replication and spread. Recent advances in glycobiological research indicate that glycans and lectins mediate key interactions at the virus-host interface, controlling viral spread and/or activation of the immune system. This review reflects on glycan-lectin interactions in the context of viral infection and antiviral immunity. A short introduction illustrates the nature of glycans and lectins, and conveys the basic principles of their interactions. Subsequently, examples are discussed highlighting specific glycan-lectin interactions and how they affect the progress of viral infections, either benefiting the host or the virus. Moreover, glycan and lectin variability and their potential biological consequences are discussed. Finally, the review outlines how recent advances in the glycan-lectin field might be transformed into promising new approaches to antiviral therapy. \copyright 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Binding of Ang {II} to its receptors (in particular {AT}(1)) mediates intracellular free radical generation that contributes to tissue damage by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction. Blocking Ang {II} signalling protects against neurodegenerative processes and promotes longevity in rodents.

abstract = {Influenza viral infections often lead to increased mortality in older people. However, the mechanisms by which aging impacts immunity to influenza lung infection remain unclear. We employed a murine model of influenza infection to identify these mechanisms. With aging, we found reduced numbers of alveolar macrophages, cells essential for lung homeostasis. We also determined that these macrophages are critical for influenza-induced mortality with aging. Furthermore, aging vastly alters the transcriptional profile and specifically downregulates cell cycling pathways in alveolar macrophages. Aging impairs the ability of alveolar macrophages to limit lung damage during influenza infection. Moreover, aging decreases alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, downregulates the scavenging receptor {CD204}, and induces retention of neutrophils during influenza infection. Thus, aging induces defective phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages and increases lung damage. These findings indicate that therapies that enhance the function of alveolar macrophages may improve outcomes in older people infected with respiratory viruses.

Adult patients with intractable epilepsy would also benefit from this dietary treatment. However, only a few studies have been published, and the use of the {KD} in intractable epilepsy in adults has been limited. This meta-analysis summarized the findings of the relevant published studies to identify the efficacy of the {KD} for the treatment of intractable epilepsy in adults. In this meta-analysis, {PubMed}, Embase, and Cochrane Library were used for searching studies concerning the effects of the {KD} and its major subtypes with intractable epilepsy in adults published up to January 10, 2017. The primary outcomes were seizure freedom, seizure reduction by 50\% or more, and seizure reduction by \textless 50\%. The quality of the methodology of the observational studies was reviewed by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We identified 402 articles, of which, 16 studies including 338 patients met the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the combined efficacy rates of all the symptoms of seizure freedom, seizure reduction by 50\% or more, and seizure reduction below 50\% in adults with intractable epilepsy were 13\%, 53\%, and 27\%, respectively. The adverse reactions of the {KD} were mild, whereas low glycemic index diet ({LGID}) and low-dose fish oil diet ({LFOD}) may have fewer side effects. Weight loss, high level of low-density lipoprotein, and elevated total cholesterol were most frequent. The meta-analysis indicates that the {KD} for refractory epilepsy in adults is a well-tolerated treatment and that its side effects are acceptable, which show that the {KD} is a promising treatment in adult intractable epilepsy. Further research is needed to assess which type of diet or ratio is more effective in the {KD} treatment.}

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus predisposes the host to bacterial infections. Moreover, hyperglycemia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for respiratory infections. The luminal surface of airway epithelia is covered by a thin layer of airway surface liquid ({ASL}) and is normally sterile despite constant exposure to bacteria. The balance between bacterial growth and killing in the airway determines the outcome of exposure to inhaled or aspirated bacteria: infection or sterility. We hypothesized that restriction of carbon sources--including glucose--in the {ASL} is required for sterility of the lungs. We found that airway epithelia deplete glucose from the {ASL} via a novel mechanism involving polarized expression of {GLUT}-1 and {GLUT}-10, intracellular glucose phosphorylation, and low relative paracellular glucose permeability in well-differentiated cultures of human airway epithelia and in segments of airway epithelia excised from human tracheas. Moreover, we found that increased glucose concentration in the {ASL} augments growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro and in the lungs of hyperglycemic ob/ob and db/db mice in vivo. In contrast, hyperglycemia had no effect on intrapulmonary bacterial growth of a P. aeruginosa mutant that is unable to utilize glucose as a carbon source. Our data suggest that depletion of glucose in the airway epithelial surface is a novel mechanism for innate immunity. This mechanism is important for sterility of the airways and has implications in hyperglycemia and conditions that result in disruption of the epithelial barrier in the lung.}

The current diagnostic and prognostic strategies in diabetes are mainly based on two tests, plasma (or capillary) glucose and glycated hemoglobin ({HbA1c}). Nevertheless, these measures are not foolproof, and their clinical usefulness is biased by a number of clinical and analytical factors. The introduction of other indices of glucose homeostasis in clinical practice such as fructosamine and glycated albumin ({GA}) may be regarded as an attractive alternative, especially in patients in whom the measurement of {HbA1c} may be biased or even unreliable. These include patients with rapid changes of glucose homeostasis and larger glycemic excursions, and patients with red blood cell disorders and renal disease. According to available evidence, the overall diagnostic efficiency of {GA} seems superior to that of fructosamine throughout a broad range of clinical settings. The current method for measuring {GA} is also better standardized and less vulnerable to preanalytical variables than those used for assessing fructosamine. Additional advantages of {GA} over {HbA1c} are represented by lower reagent cost and being able to automate the {GA} analysis on many conventional laboratory instruments. Although further studies are needed to definitely establish that {GA} can complement or even replace conventional measures of glycemic control such as {HbA1c}, {GA} may help the clinical management of patients with diabetes in whom {HbA1c} values might be unreliable. \copyright 2015 Diabetes Technology Society.}

Here, backscattering interferometry ({BSI}) has been shown to be a convenient and sensitive method for obtaining quantitative information about the strengths and selectivities of such interactions. The surfaces of glass microfluidic channels were covalently modified with extravidin, to which biotinylated lectins were subsequently attached by incubation and washing. The binding of unmodified carbohydrates to the resulting avidin-immobilized lectins was monitored by {BSI}. Dose-response curves that were generated within several minutes and were highly reproducible in multiple wash/measure cycles provided adsorption coefficients that showed mannose to bind to concanavalin A ({conA}) with 3.7 times greater affinity than glucose consistent with literature values. Galactose was observed to bind selectively and with similar affinity to the lectin {BS}-1. The avidities of polyvalent sugar-coated virus particles for immobilized {conA} were much higher than monovalent glycans, with increases of 60-200 fold per glycan when arrayed on the exterior surface of cowpea mosaic virus or bacteriophage Qbeta. Sugar-functionalized {PAMAM} dendrimers showed size-dependent adsorption, which was consistent with the expected density of lectins on the surface. The sensitivity of {BSI} matches or exceeds that of surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance techniques, and is sensitive to the number of binding events, rather than changes in mass. The operational simplicity and generality of {BSI}, along with the near-native conditions under which the target binding proteins are immobilized, make {BSI} an attractive method for the quantitative characterization of the binding functions of lectins and other proteins.}

Lower respiratory infections in the absence of lung disease are therefore relatively infrequent as compared with upper respiratory tract infections in healthy adults.

As these infections contribute considerably to the clinical course of the patient with {COPD}, they constitute a significant comorbidity in {COPD}. Recurrent acute infections by bacterial and/or viral pathogens are now clearly linked with the occurrence of exacerbations of {COPD}. In addition, the occurrence of pneumonia in {COPD} has received considerable recent attention as it appears to be increased by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. The role of chronic infection in the pathogenesis of {COPD} is an active area of research with several different types of pathogens potentially implicated. Additionally, {COPD} patients with {HIV} infection have a more rapidly progressive decline in lung function than non-{HIV}-infected patients.

However, the extent to which hyperglycaemia contributes to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease is still not clear. Epidemiological studies published in recent years suggest that postprandial blood glucose might be an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. The main results of these studies, which are reviewed in this article, are that subjects from the general population with mild to moderate hyperglycaemia, following oral glucose load, but not in the fasting state, showed an increased cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, the post-challenge as well as postprandial glucose concentrations of subjects with Type {II} diabetes were found to be directly associated to incident cardiovascular disease independently of fasting glucose. Also, the correction of fasting hyperglycaemia or {HbA1} c or both, disregarding the specific correction of postprandial hyperglycaemia was not found to significantly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with Type {II} diabetes. Finally, the strict control of both preprandial and postprandial hyperglycaemia yielded a substantial reduction of cardiovascular disease in Type {II} diabetes. Trials specifically designed to address this issue are needed to determine whether postprandial hyperglycaemia plays an independent and causative role in cardiovascular disease in patients with Type {II} diabetes.}

Convincing data place energy metabolism at the center of metformin's mechanism of action in diabetes and may also be of importance in cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Metformin-induced activation of the energy-sensor {AMPK} is well documented, but may not account for all actions of the drug. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the different {AMPK}-dependent and {AMPK}-independent mechanisms underlying metformin action. Copyright \copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, a chronic neurodegenerative condition, is increasing as is the need for effective treatments and preventions. The underlying pathology of Alzheimer's is not yet fully understood, so existing research has focused on understanding the prominent features of the disease. These include amyloid plaques, which accumulate in the brains of those with Alzheimer's disease; impaired glucose metabolism; and neuronal cell death. Emerging evidence suggests that a low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet may help to mitigate the damage associated with these pathologies. The ketogenic diet could alleviate the effects of impaired glucose metabolism by providing ketones as a supplementary energy source. In addition, this diet may help to reduce the accumulation of amyloid plaques while reversing amyloid \beta toxicity. Research has begun to identify early underlying mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease that could be targeted by new prevention strategies. Glycation of the {ApoE} protein leads to impaired transportation of important lipids, including cholesterol, to the brain, resulting in lipid deficiencies that could explain progression to the later pathologies of the disease. In this review, we hypothesize that the ketogenic diet could be an effective treatment and prevention for Alzheimer's disease, but both ketone production and carbohydrate restriction may be needed to achieve this.

Wild-type {C57BL}/6 or db/db (leptin receptor-deficient) mice, 6-10 weeks old, were treated with intraperitoneal phosphate-buffered saline or 40 mg/kg metformin for 2 days before intranasal inoculation with 1×10(7) {CFU} S aureus. Mice were culled 24 h after infection and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected. {RESULTS}: Apical S aureus growth increased with basolateral glucose concentration in an in vitro airway epithelia-bacteria co-culture model. S aureus reduced transepithelial electrical resistance ({RT}) and increased paracellular glucose flux. Metformin inhibited the glucose-induced growth of S aureus, increased {RT} and decreased glucose flux. Diabetic (db/db) mice infected with S aureus exhibited a higher bacterial load in their airways than control mice after 2 days and metformin treatment reversed this effect. Metformin did not decrease blood glucose but reduced paracellular flux across ex vivo murine tracheas. {CONCLUSIONS}: Hyperglycaemia promotes respiratory S aureus infection, and metformin modifies glucose flux across the airway epithelium to limit hyperglycaemia-induced bacterial growth. Metformin might, therefore, be of additional benefit in the prevention and treatment of respiratory infection.}

In this review, we summarize epidemiological data relating to diabetes mellitus and {CVD}, with an emphasis on the aging population. We then present data on hyperglycemia as a risk factor for {CVD} and review the current knowledge of age-related changes in glucose metabolism.

We then conclude with our proposed model of aging that body composition changes and insulin resistance link possible dysregulation of physiological pathways leading to obesity and diabetes mellitus-both forms of accelerated aging-and risks for {CVD}.}

Despite this, the mechanisms by which diabetes contributes to plaque formation remain in question. Some of this confusion derives from studies in type 2 diabetics where multiple components of metabolic syndrome show proatherosclerotic effects independent of underlying diabetes. However, the hyperglycemia that defines the diabetic condition independently affects atherogenesis in cell culture systems, animal models, and human patients. Endothelial cell biology plays a central role in atherosclerotic plaque formation regulating vessel permeability, inflammation, and thrombosis. The current paper highlights the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia affects endothelial cell biology to promote plaque formation.}

Synthetic applications of these enzymes, i.e. to catalyse the reverse of their natural hydrolytic mode of action, allow the attachment of N-glycans to a wide variety of substrates which contain an N-acetylglucosamine ({GlcNAc}) residue to act as an 'acceptor' handle. The use of N-glycan oxazolines, high energy intermediates on the hydrolytic pathway, as activated donors allows their high yielding attachment to almost any amino acid, peptide or protein that contains a {GlcNAc} residue as an acceptor. The synthetic effectiveness of these biocatalysts has been significantly increased by the production of mutant glycosynthases; enzymes which can still catalyse synthetic processes using oxazolines as donors, but which do not hydrolyse the reaction products. {ENGase} biocatalysts are now finding burgeoning application for the production of biologically active glycopeptides and glycoproteins, including therapeutic monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) for which the oligosaccharides have been remodelled to optimise effector functions.}

abstract = {Glucose is the main energy substrate in the adult brain under normal conditions. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that lactate produced in astrocytes (a type of glial cell) can also fuel neuronal activity. The quantitative aspects of this so-called astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle ({ANLS}) are still debated. To address this question, we developed a detailed biophysical model of the brain's metabolic interactions. Our model integrates three modeling approaches, the Buxton-Wang model of vascular dynamics, the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of neuronal membrane excitability and a biophysical model of metabolic pathways. This approach provides a template for large-scale simulations of the neuron-glia-vasculature ({NGV}) ensemble, and for the first time integrates the respective timescales at which energy metabolism and neuronal excitability occur. The model is constrained by relative neuronal and astrocytic oxygen and glucose utilization, by the concentration of metabolites at rest and by the temporal dynamics of {NADH} upon activation. These constraints produced four observations. First, a transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons emerged in response to activity. Second, constrained by activity-dependent {NADH} transients, neuronal oxidative metabolism increased first upon activation with a subsequent delayed astrocytic glycolysis increase. Third, the model correctly predicted the dynamics of extracellular lactate and oxygen as observed in vivo in rats. Fourth, the model correctly predicted the temporal dynamics of tissue lactate, of tissue glucose and oxygen consumption, and of the {BOLD} signal as reported in human studies. These findings not only support the {ANLS} hypothesis but also provide a quantitative mathematical description of the metabolic activation in neurons and glial cells, as well as of the macroscopic measurements obtained during brain imaging.}

Elucidating glycoprotein microheterogeneity and relating subtle changes in the glycan structural repertoire to changes in protein-protein, or protein-small molecule interactions, remains a significant challenge in glycobiology. Here, we apply mass spectrometry-based approaches to elucidate the global and site-specific microheterogeneity of two plasma proteins: \alpha1-acid glycoprotein ({AGP}) and haptoglobin (Hp). We then determine the dissociation constants of the anticoagulant warfarin to different {AGP} glycoforms and reveal how subtle N-glycan differences, namely, increased antennae branching and terminal fucosylation, reduce drug-binding affinity. Conversely, similar analysis of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin (Hp-Hb) complex reveals the contrary effects of fucosylation and N-glycan branching on Hp-Hb interactions. Taken together, our results not only elucidate how glycoprotein microheterogeneity regulates protein-drug/protein interactions but also inform the pharmacokinetics of plasma proteins, many of which are drug targets, and whose glycosylation status changes in various disease states.

Live-cell confocal images acquired 60 minutes after apical addition of Texas Red-dextran-containing fluid revealed significantly greater {ASL} heights after {AICAR} and metformin treatment relative to controls, suggesting that {AMPK}-dependent {ENaC} inhibition slows apical fluid reabsorption. Both metformin and {AICAR} decreased secretion of various proinflammatory cytokines, both with and without prior {LPS} stimulation. Finally, prolonged exposure to more physiologically relevant concentrations of metformin (0.03-1 {mM}) inhibited {ENaC} currents and decreased proinflammatory cytokine levels in {CF} {HBE} cells in a dose-dependent manner.

abstract = {The ability to regulate cell volume is crucial for normal physiology; equally the regulation of extracellular fluid homeostasis is of great importance. Alteration of normal extracellular fluid homeostasis contributes to the development of several diseases including cystic fibrosis. With regard to the airway surface liquid ({ASL}), which lies apically on top of airway epithelia, ion content, {pH}, mucin and protein abundance must be tightly regulated. Furthermore, airway epithelia must be able to switch from an absorptive to a secretory state as required. A heterogeneous population of airway epithelial cells regulate {ASL} solute and solvent composition, and directly secrete large mucin molecules, antimicrobials, proteases and soluble mediators into the airway lumen. This review focuses on how epithelial ion transport influences {ASL} hydration and {ASL} {pH}, with a specific focus on the roles of anion and cation channels and exchangers. The role of ions and {pH} in mucin expansion is also addressed. With regard to fluid volume regulation, we discuss the roles of nucleotides, adenosine and the short palate lung and nasal epithelial clone 1 ({SPLUNC1}) as soluble {ASL} mediators. Together, these mechanisms directly influence ciliary beating and in turn mucociliary clearance to maintain sterility and to detoxify the airways. Whilst all of these components are regulated in normal airways, defective ion transport and/or mucin secretion proves detrimental to lung homeostasis as such we address how defective ion and fluid transport, and a loss of homeostatic mechanisms, contributes to the development of pathophysiologies associated with cystic fibrosis.

Acute hyperglycaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients in intensive care units and patients with acute respiratory disease. The present review will consider mechanisms underlying this association. In normal lungs the glucose concentration of airway secretions is approximately 10-fold lower than that of plasma. Low airway glucose concentrations are maintained against a concentration gradient by active glucose transport. Airway glucose concentrations become elevated if normal homeostasis is disrupted by a rise in blood glucose concentrations or inflammation of the airway epithelium. Elevated airway glucose concentrations are associated with and precede increased isolation of respiratory pathogens, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, from bronchial aspirates of patients intubated on intensive care. Markers of elevated airway glucose are associated with similar patterns of respiratory infection in patients admitted with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Glucose at airway concentrations stimulates the growth of respiratory pathogens, over and above the effect of other nutrients. Elevated airway glucose concentrations may also worsen respiratory disease by promoting local inflammation. Hyperglycaemia may thus promote pulmonary infection, at least in part, by an effect on airway glucose concentrations. Therapeutic options, including systemic control of blood glucose and local manipulation of airway glucose homeostasis, will be considered.}

abstract = {Enveloped viruses encompass some of the most common human pathogens causing infections of different severity, ranging from no or very few symptoms to lethal disease as seen with the viral hemorrhagic fevers. All enveloped viruses possess an envelope membrane derived from the host cell, modified with often heavily glycosylated virally encoded glycoproteins important for infectivity, viral particle formation and immune evasion. While N-linked glycosylation of viral envelope proteins is well characterized with respect to location, structure and site occupancy, information on mucin-type O-glycosylation of these proteins is less comprehensive. Studies on viral glycosylation are often limited to analysis of recombinant proteins that in most cases are produced in cell lines with a glycosylation capacity different from the capacity of the host cells. The glycosylation pattern of the produced recombinant glycoproteins might therefore be different from the pattern on native viral proteins. In this review, we provide a historical perspective on analysis of viral glycosylation, and summarize known roles of glycans in the biology of enveloped human viruses. In addition, we describe how to overcome the analytical limitations by using a global approach based on mass spectrometry to identify viral O-glycosylation in virus-infected cell lysates using the complex enveloped virus herpes simplex virus type 1 as a model. We underscore that glycans often pay important contributions to overall protein structure, function and immune recognition, and that glycans represent a crucial determinant for vaccine design. High throughput analysis of glycosylation on relevant glycoprotein formulations, as well as data compilation and sharing is therefore important to identify consensus glycosylation patterns for translational applications.}

In this review we explored the possible role of low-carb and ketogenic diets in the pathogenesis and management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Furthermore, we also reviewed evidence of carbohydrates restriction in both pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, through gut microbiota modification, and treatment of type 1 diabetes, addressing the legitimate concerns about the use of such diets in patients who are ketosis-prone and often have not completed their growth.}

abstract = {Hyperglycemia is a frequent complication of enteral and parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients. Extensive evidence from observational studies indicates that the development of hyperglycemia during parenteral and enteral nutrition is associated with an increased risk of death and infectious complications. There are no specific guidelines recommending glycemic targets and effective strategies for the management of hyperglycemia during specialized nutritional support. Managing hyperglycemia in these patients should include optimization of carbohydrate content and administration of intravenous or subcutaneous insulin therapy. The administration of continuous insulin infusion and insulin addition to nutrition bag are efficient approaches to control hyperglycemia during parenteral nutrition. Subcutaneous administration of long-acting insulin with scheduled or corrective doses of short-acting insulin is superior to the sliding scale insulin strategy in patients receiving enteral feedings. Randomized controlled studies are needed to evaluate safe and effective therapeutic strategies for the management of hyperglycemia in patients receiving nutritional support.}

As obligate parasites, viruses exploit host-cell machinery to glycosylate their own proteins during replication. Viral envelope proteins from a variety of human pathogens including {HIV}-1, influenza virus, Lassa virus, {SARS}, Zika virus, dengue virus, and Ebola virus have evolved to be extensively glycosylated. These host-cell derived glycans facilitate diverse structural and functional roles during the viral life-cycle, ranging from immune evasion by glycan shielding to enhancement of immune cell infection. In this review, we highlight the imperative and auxiliary roles glycans play, and how specific oligosaccharide structures facilitate these functions during viral pathogenesis.

abstract = {Alveolar epithelial cells ({AEC}) are directly exposed to high alveolar O(2) tension. Many pulmonary disorders are associated with a decrease in alveolar O(2) tension and {AEC} need to develop adaptative mechanisms to cope with O(2) deprivation. Under hypoxia, because of inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, adenosine triphosphate supply is dependent on the ability of cells to increase anaerobic glycolysis. In this study we show that under hypoxia, primary rat {AEC} maintained their energy status close to that of normoxic cells through increasing anaerobic glycolysis. We therefore examined the effect of hypoxia on glucose transport and evaluated the mechanisms of this regulation. Hypoxia induced a stimulation of Na-independent glucose transport, as shown by the increase in 2-deoxy-D-glucose ({DG}) uptake. This increase was dependent on time and O(2) concentration: maximal at 0\% O(2) for 18 h, and reversible after hypoxic cells were allowed to recover in normoxia. Concomitantly, exposure of {AEC} to hypoxia (18 h 0\% O(2)) induced a 3-fold increase of glucose transporter {GLUT1} at both protein and messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) levels. To determine whether the increase in {GLUT1} {mRNA} level was dependent on O(2) deprivation per se or resulted from decrease of oxidative phosphorylation, we examined in normoxic cells the effects of cobalt chloride and Na azide, respectively. Cobalt chloride (100 {microM}) and Na azide (1 {mM}) increased both {mRNA} levels and {DG} uptake, mimicking the effect of hypoxia. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a hypoxic and a cobalt chloride induction of a hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF}) that bound to the sequence of nucleotides, corresponding to a hypoxia-inducible element upstream of the {GLUT1} gene. {AEC} also expressed this factor under nonhypoxic conditions. Together, our results demonstrate that {AEC} increased glucose transport in response to hypoxia by regulating {GLUT1} gene-encoding protein. This regulation likely occurred at the transcriptional level through the activation of an {HIF}, the nature of which remains to be elucidated.}

abstract = {{RLR}-mediated type I {IFN} production plays a pivotal role in elevating host immunity for viral clearance and cancer immune surveillance. Here, we report that glycolysis, which is inactivated during {RLR} activation, serves as a barrier to impede type I {IFN} production upon {RLR} activation. {RLR}-triggered {MAVS}-{RIG}-I recognition hijacks hexokinase binding to {MAVS}, leading to the impairment of hexokinase mitochondria localization and activation. Lactate serves as a key metabolite responsible for glycolysis-mediated {RLR} signaling inhibition by directly binding to {MAVS} transmembrane ({TM}) domain and preventing {MAVS} aggregation. Notably, lactate restoration reverses increased {IFN} production caused by lactate deficiency. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that lactate reduction by lactate dehydrogenase A ({LDHA}) inactivation heightens type I {IFN} production to protect mice from viral infection. Our study establishes a critical role of glycolysis-derived lactate in limiting {RLR} signaling and identifies {MAVS} as a direct sensor of lactate, which functions to connect energy metabolism and innate immunity.

Hyperglycaemia, hypertension and obesity, major components of metabolic syndrome, are all associated with increased systemic and tissue levels of Ang {II}. Whereas it is well established that Ang {II}, by binding to {AT1R}, impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin signaling, the contribution of alternative {RAS} axes to \beta-cell function remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, using the {BRIN}-{BD11} rat insulinoma cell line, we i) examined the basal expression levels of components of classical and alternative {RAS} axes and ii) investigated the effects of normal (5.5 {mM}) and elevated (11, 15, 25 {mM}) glucose concentrations on their expression and/or enzymatic activity by means of reverse transcription quantitative {PCR} ({RT}-{qPCR}), immunoblot analysis and enzymatic activity assays. The results correlated with the insulin production and release. Essential components of all {RAS} axes were found to be expressed in the {BRIN}-{BD11} cells. Components of the alternative {RAS} axes, {ACE2}, neutral endopeptidase 24.11, Mas receptor (Mas), aminopeptidases A ({APA}) and N ({APN}) and insulin-regulated aminopeptidase ({IRAP}) showed an increased expression/activity in response to high glucose. These alterations were paralleled by the glucose-dependent increase in insulin production and release. By contrast, components of the classical {RAS} axis, {ACE}, {AT1R} and Ang {II} type 2 receptor ({AT2R}), remained largely unaffected under these conditions. Glucose induced the activation of the alternative {ACE2}/Ang-(1-7)/Mas and {APN}/Ang {IV}/{IRAP} {RAS} axes simultaneously with the stimulation of insulin production/release. Our data suggest the existence of a functional link between the local {RAS} axis and pancreatic \beta-cell function; however, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.}

Apart from leukocytes and endothelial cells, macrophages are also essential for the process of the inflammatory response in {ALI}/{ARDS}. Notably, macrophages play a dual role of proinflammation and anti-inflammation based on the microenvironment in different pathological stages. In the acute phase of {ALI}/{ARDS}, resident alveolar macrophages, typically expressing the alternatively activated phenotype (M2), shift into the classically activated phenotype (M1) and release various potent proinflammatory mediators. In the later phase, the M1 phenotype of activated resident and recruited macrophages shifts back to the M2 phenotype for eliminating apoptotic cells and participating in fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the main subsets of macrophages and the associated signaling pathways in three different pathological phases of {ALI}/{ARDS}. According to the current literature, regulating the function of macrophages and monocytes might be a promising therapeutic strategy against {ALI}/{ARDS}.}

We report here that {RV} induces metabolic alterations in host cells, which offer an efficient target for antiviral intervention. We show that {RV}-infected cells rapidly up-regulate glucose uptake in a {PI3K}-dependent manner. In parallel, infected cells enhance the expression of the {PI3K}-regulated glucose transporter {GLUT1}. In-depth metabolomic analysis of {RV}-infected cells revealed a critical role of glucose mobilization from extracellular and intracellular pools via glycogenolysis for viral replication. Infection resulted in a highly anabolic state, including enhanced nucleotide synthesis and lipogenesis. Consistently, we observed that glucose deprivation from medium and via glycolysis inhibition by 2-deoxyglucose (2-{DG}) potently impairs viral replication. Metabolomic analysis showed that 2-{DG} specifically reverts the {RV}-induced anabolic reprogramming. In addition, treatment with 2-{DG} inhibited {RV} infection and inflammation in a murine model. Thus, we demonstrate that the specific metabolic fingerprint of {RV} infection can be used to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.}

These life-threatening syndromes are caused by increased permeability of the alveolar and airway epithelium and exudate formation. However, the mechanism underlying epithelium barrier breakdown in the lung during inflammation is elusive.

abstract = {For over 50 years, glucose has been recognised to cross the lung epithelial barrier and be transported by lung epithelial cells. However, until recently, research into these processes focused on their effects on lung liquid volume. Here, we consider a newly identified role for pulmonary glucose transport in maintaining low airway surface liquid ({ASL}) glucose concentrations and propose that this contributes to lung defence against infection. Glucose diffuses into {ASL} via paracellular pathways at a rate determined by paracellular permeability and the transepithelial glucose gradient. Glucose is removed from {ASL} in proximal airways via facilitative glucose transporters, down a concentration gradient generated by intracellular glucose metabolism. In the distal lung, glucose transport via sodium-coupled glucose transporters predominates. These processes vary between species but universally maintain {ASL} glucose at 3-20-fold lower concentrations than plasma. {ASL} glucose concentrations are increased in respiratory disease and by hyperglycaemia. Elevated {ASL} glucose in intensive care patients was associated with increased Staphylococcus aureus infection. Diabetic patients with and without chronic lung disease are at increased risk of respiratory infection. Understanding of mechanisms underlying lung glucose homeostasis could identify new therapeutic targets for control of {ASL} glucose and prevention and treatment of lung infection.}

abstract = {The effect of exogenous lactate on glycolytic rate was studied with the isolated perfused rat lung. Glucose utilization was estimated from the rate of {3H2O} production from [5-{3H}]glucose, and lactate and pyruvate production was measured by perfusate assay. Glucose utilization was unaffected by addition of 0.5 {mM} lactate to the perfusate but decreased by 27\% with 1 {mM} lactate. With 2 {mM} lactate, glucose utilization was decreased by 46\% and lactate production decreased 95\%. With addition of 0.2 {mM} pyruvate plus 2 {mM} lactate, glucose utilization was decreased 63\% compared with control. These data indicate that the effect of lactate on glucose utilization was not through change in the cellular redox state. During lung anoxia produced by ventilation with {CO}, glucose utilization and lactate production were again markedly decreased by addition of lactate (2 {mM}) to the perfusate. However, addition of pyruvate plus lactate resulted in a markedly stimulated rate of glucose utilization. This result indicates that during anoxia the effect of lactate on glycolysis resulted from alteration of the redox ratio. This study indicates that lactate influences the rate of glycolysis in the normal lung through its utilization as a substrate for mitochondrial metabolism. During anoxia, changes in the lung redox state with lactate are a major determinant of the glycolytic rate.}

abstract = {The interaction between diabetes and major world infections like {TB} is a major public health concern because of rapidly rising levels of diabetes. The dual burden of tuberculosis ({TB}) and diabetes mellitus ({DM}) has become a major global public health problem. Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of active and latent tuberculosis. Immune mechanisms contributing to the increased susceptibility of diabetic patients to {TB} are due to the defects in bacterial recognition, phagocytic activity, and cellular activation which results in impaired production of chemokines and cytokines. The initiation of adaptive immunity is delayed by impaired antigen-presenting cell ({APC}) recruitment and function in hyperglycemic host, which results in reduced frequencies of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and its secretion of cytokines having a great role in activation of macrophage and inflammatory response of tuberculosis. In addition, impaired immune response and killing of intracellular bacteria potentially increase bacterial load, chronic inflammation, and central necrosis that facilitate bacterial dissemination and miliary tuberculosis. Understanding of the immunological and biochemical basis of {TB} susceptibility in diabetic patients will tell us the rational development of implementation and therapeutic strategies to alleviate the dual burden of the diseases. Therefore, the aim of this review was focused on the association between diabetes and tuberculosis, focusing on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and immune dysfunction in diabetes mellitus, and its association with susceptibility, severity, and treatment outcome failure to tuberculosis.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although obese patients have high thrombosis rates following injury, the role of obesity in coagulation after trauma remains unknown. We hypothesized that body mass index ({BMI}) is independently associated with increased measures of hypercoagulability longitudinally after injury. {METHODS}: Data were prospectively collected for 377 consecutive highest-level trauma activation patients with a {BMI} of 18.5 kg/m² or greater. Standard coagulation measures, citrated kaolin and functional fibrinogen thromboelastography, as well as clotting factors were measured at 0 hour to 120 hours. {BMI} categories were defined as normal weight (18.5-24.99 kg/m²), overweight (25-29.99 kg/m²), and obese (≥30 kg/m²). {RESULTS}: The 377 patients were mostly male (81\%) and had blunt injury (61\%), with a median {BMI} of 25.8 kg/m². Of the patients, 42\% were normal weight (median {BMI}, 22.5 kg/m²). There were no differences in age, sex, Injury Severity Score ({I\SS}), or base deficit between groups. There were no differences in admission international normalized ratio/partial thromboplastin time or factors {II}, V, {VII}, {VIII}, and X; antithrombin {III}; or protein C. However, obese patients had higher admission platelet counts (303 × 10⁹/L vs. 269 × 10⁹/L, p = 0.004), lower D-dimer (1.88 μg/{mL} vs. 4.00 μg/{mL}, p = 0.004), and a trend toward higher factor {IX} (134\% vs. 119\% activity, p = 0.042) compared with normal weight patients. Measured by thromboelastography, clot strength (maximum amplitude) and functional fibrinogen level ({FLEV}) were also higher on admission for obese patients (maximum amplitude, 65.7 mm vs. 63.4 mm, p = 0.016; {FLEV}, 407 mg/{dL} vs. 351 mg/{dL}, p = 0.008). In multiple linear regression, the relationship of {BMI} to clot strength, {FLEV}, and factor {IX} persisted through 24 hours. Similarly, the relationship of {BMI} and platelet count persisted through 120 hours (all p \textless 0.05). In multiple logistic regression, for every 5-kg/m² increase in {BMI}, there was an 85\% increase in odds of thromboembolic complication (odds ratio, 1.85; 95\% confidence interval, 1.13-3.08; p = 0.017). {CONCLUSION}: Obese trauma patients are hypercoagulable compared with their similarly injured normal-weight counterparts, which persists longitudinally after injury.

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is characterized by a high risk of atherothrombotic events. What is more, venous thrombosis has also been found to occur more frequently in this patient group. This prothrombotic condition in diabetes is underpinned by laboratory findings of elevated coagulation factors and impaired fibrinolysis. Hyperglycemia plays an important role in the development of these hemostatic abnormalities, as is illustrated by the association with glycemic control and the improvement upon treatment of hyperglycemia. Interestingly, stress induced hyperglycemia, which is often transient, has also been associated with poor outcome in thrombotic disease. Similar laboratory findings suggest a common effect of acute vs. chronic hyperglycemia on the coagulation system. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this prothrombotic shift in hyperglycemia, such as a direct effect on gene transcription of coagulation factors caused by hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, loss of the endothelial glycocalyx layer, which harbours coagulation factors, and direct glycation of coagulation factors, altering their activity. In addition, both chronic and acute hyperglycemia are often accompanied by hyperinsulinemia, which has been shown to have prothrombotic effects as well. In conclusion, the laboratory evidence of the effects of both chronic and acute hyperglycemia suggests a prothrombotic shift. Additionally, hyperglycemia is associated with poor clinical outcome of thrombotic events. Whether intensive treatment of hyperglycemia can prevent hypercoagulability and improve clinical outcome remains to be investigated. \copyright 2010 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.}

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swab samples according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol. A probable case was defined as fever \textgreater 38ºC or aches or asthenia with respiratory symptoms (cough or dyspnea). All confirmed and probable hospitalized cases were reported, along with patient's age, sex, clinical condition at admission, place and length of hospitalization, antiviral treatment, underlying conditions, complications, and clinical evolution. A case was classified as severe if respiratory assistance or intensive care was required or if death resulted. {RESULTS}: A total of 331 confirmed and 16 probable cases were hospitalized, with a hospitalization rate ranging from 4.3 per 1 000 clinical cases in Saint Martin to 10.3 in French Guiana. Of these, 36 were severe, and subsequently, 10 were fatal. The median length of stay was 4 days for non-severe cases and 9 days for severe (P \textless 0.05). The mean patient age was 21 years, and severe cases were significantly older than non-severe (mean: 38 years versus 19 years, P \textless 0.05). Underlying conditions associated with a higher risk of severity were 65 years of age or more ({RR} = 7.5, 95\%{CI} = 4.2-13.3), diabetes ({RR} = 3.7, 95\%{CI} = 1.5-9.4), cardiac insufficiency ({RR} = 8.4, 95\%{CI} = 5.2-13.6), and morbid obesity ({RR} = 4.4, 95\%{CI} = 1.8-10.4). Patients who received antiviral treatment within 2 days of symptom onset had shorter hospital stays (mean: 4 days versus 6.5 days, P \textless 0.05), and the illness tended to become less severe (11.1\% versus 19.0\%, P = 0.13). {CONCLUSIONS}: Active research of hospitalized cases enabled almost exhaustive surveillance. The pandemic's hospitalization rates and lethality were more moderate than expected. Some previously known underlying conditions of severity were confirmed during this outbreak. Furthermore, these results show the validity of early antiviral treatment.}

Expansion of these protective \gamma\delta T cells required metabolic adaptation to a ketogenic diet because neither feeding mice a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet nor providing chemical ketone body substrate that bypasses hepatic ketogenesis protected against infection.

However, rates of obesity and diabetes rose markedly throughout this period, with potentially catastrophic implications for public health and the economy. Recently, ketogenic diets have received substantial attention from the general public and nutrition research community. These very-low-carbohydrate diets, with fat comprising \textgreater70\% of calories, have been dismissed as fads. However, they have a long history in clinical medicine and human evolution. Ketogenic diets appear to be more effective than low-fat diets for treatment of obesity and diabetes. In addition to the reductions in blood glucose and insulin achievable through carbohydrate restriction, chronic ketosis might confer unique metabolic benefits of relevance to cancer, neurodegenerative conditions, and other diseases associated with insulin resistance. Based on available evidence, a well-formulated ketogenic diet does not appear to have major safety concerns for the general public and can be considered a first-line approach for obesity and diabetes. High-quality clinical trials of ketogenic diets will be needed to assess important questions about their long-term effects and full potential in clinical medicine.

abstract = {Pulmonary innate immune responses involve a highly regulated multicellular network to defend the enormous surface area of the lung. Disruption of these responses renders the host susceptible to pneumonia. Alveolar epithelial cells ({AEC}) are a critical source of innate immune molecules such as {GM}-{CSF}, which determine the functional maturation of alveolar macrophages. In many pulmonary diseases, heterogeneous ventilation leads to regional hypoxia in the lung. The effect of hypoxia on {AEC} innate immune function is unknown. We now report that exposure of primary murine {AEC} to hypoxia (1\% oxygen) for 24 h results in significant suppression of key innate immune molecules, including {GM}-{CSF}, {CCL2}, and {IL}-6. This exposure did not cause toxicity but did induce stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\alpha protein ({HIF}-1\alpha) and shift to glycolytic metabolism. Focusing on {GM}-{CSF}, we found that hypoxia greatly decreased the rate of {GM}-{CSF} transcription. Hypoxia both decreased {NF}-{\kappaB} signaling in {AEC} and induced chromosomal changes, resulting in decreased accessibility in the {GM}-{CSF} proximal promoter of target sequences for {NF}-{\kappaB} binding. In mice exposed to hypoxia in vivo (12\% oxygen for 2 d), lung {GM}-{CSF} protein expression was reduced. In vivo phagocytosis of fluorescent beads by alveolar macrophages was also suppressed, but this effect was reversed by treatment with {GM}-{CSF}. These studies suggest that in critically ill patients, local hypoxia may contribute to the susceptibility of poorly ventilated lung units to infection through complementary effects on several pathways, reducing {AEC} expression of {GM}-{CSF} and other key innate immune molecules.

abstract = {Macrophages are key cellular components of the innate immunity, acting as the main player in the first-line defence against the pathogens and modulating homeostatic and inflammatory responses. Plasticity is a major feature of macrophages resulting in extreme heterogeneity both in normal and in pathological conditions. Macrophages are not homogenous, and they are generally categorized into two broad but distinct subsets as either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2). However, macrophages represent a continuum of highly plastic effector cells, resembling a spectrum of diverse phenotype states. Induction of specific macrophage functions is closely related to the surrounding environment that acts as a relevant orchestrator of macrophage functions. This phenomenon, termed polarization, results from cell/cell, cell/molecule interaction, governing macrophage functionality within the hosting tissues. Here, we summarized relevant cellular and molecular mechanisms driving macrophage polarization in "distant" pathological conditions, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and periodontitis that share macrophage-driven inflammation as a key feature, playing their dual role as killers (M1-like) and/or builders (M2-like). We also dissect the physio/pathological consequences related to macrophage polarization within selected chronic inflammatory diseases, placing polarized macrophages as a relevant hallmark, putative biomarkers, and possible target for prevention/therapy.}

It first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its S1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its S2 subunit. Two domains in S1 from different coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, leading to viral attachment. The spike protein exists in two structurally distinct conformations, prefusion and postfusion. The transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the spike protein must be triggered, leading to membrane fusion. This article reviews current knowledge about the structures and functions of coronavirus spike proteins, illustrating how the two S1 domains recognize different receptors and how the spike proteins are regulated to undergo conformational transitions. I further discuss the evolution of these two critical functions of coronavirus spike proteins, receptor recognition and membrane fusion, in the context of the corresponding functions from other viruses and host cells.}

They spanned the full weight range (underweight/normal/overweight/obese). Latent class analysis and multivariate generalised linear models were used to investigate the association of Body Mass Index ({BMI}, kg/m2) trajectory over twelve years with plasma insulin (μ{lU}/ml), plasma glucose (mmol/L), and {HOMA2} insulin resistance and beta cell function at follow-up. All models were adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, pre-clinical diabetes status (normal fasting glucose or impaired fasting glucose) and physical activity. Four weight trajectories were extracted; constant normal (mean baseline {BMI} = 25; follow-up {BMI} = 25), constant high (mean baseline {BMI} = 36; follow-up {BMI} = 37), increase (mean baseline {BMI} = 26; follow-up {BMI} = 32) and decrease (mean baseline {BMI} = 34; follow-up {BMI} = 28). At any given current {BMI}, individuals in the constant high and increase trajectories had significantly higher plasma insulin, greater insulin resistance, and higher beta cell function than those in the constant normal trajectory. Individuals in the decrease trajectory did not differ from the constant normal trajectory. Current {BMI} significantly interacted with preceding {BMI} trajectory in its association with plasma insulin, insulin resistance, and beta cell function. {CONCLUSION}: The trajectory of preceding weight has an independent effect on blood glucose metabolism beyond body weight measured at any given point in time.

Patients who died during follow-up had significantly higher plasma {SP}-D levels than those who survived (median 85.4 vs. 64.8 ng/{mL}; P \textless 0.0001). Those in the highest quintile of {SP}-D had 4.4-fold higher risk of {CVD} mortality than those in the lowest quintile (P \textless 0.0001) independent of age, sex, and plasma lipid levels. In a group of current and ex-smokers without a known history of {CAD}, serum {SP}-D levels were elevated in those who died or were hospitalized for {CVD} compared with those who did not (median 99.8 vs. 90.6 ng/{mL}; P = 0.0001). {CONCLUSION}: Circulating {SP}-D is a good predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and adds prognostic information to well-established risk factors such as age, sex, and plasma lipids and is a promising biomarker to link lung inflammation/injury to {CVD}.}

abstract = {Importance: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV})-infected pneumonia ({NCIP}) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of {NCIP}. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed {NCIP} at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented {NCIP}. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with {NCIP}, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3\%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29\%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3\%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6\%]), fatigue (96 [69.6\%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4\%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range \{{IQR\}}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3\%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [{IQR}, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58\%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [{IQR}, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9\%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9\%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4\%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6\%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1\%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9\%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1\%) were transferred to the intensive care unit ({ICU}) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1\%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4\%]), and shock (11 [30.6\%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to {ARDS} was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the {ICU} (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the {ICU} (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2\%] vs 38 [37.3\%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9\%] vs 20 [19.6\%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7\%] vs 31 [30.4\%]). Of the 36 cases in the {ICU}, 4 (11.1\%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7\%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2\%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1\%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3\%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days ({IQR}, 7.0-14.0). Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed {NCIP} in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-{nCoV} was suspected in 41\% of patients, 26\% of patients received {ICU} care, and mortality was 4.3\%.}

abstract = {Background: Persistent hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus causes coagulopathies due to glycation of haemoglobin, prothrombin, fibrinogen and other proteins involved in the clotting mechanism. Shortened activated partial thromboplastin time ({APTT}) and prothrombin time ({PT}) reflect hypercoagulable state, which is associated with an increased thrombotic risk and adverse cardiovascular effects. This study assessed the coagulation profile of type 2 diabetes mellitus ({T2DM}) clients at a municipal hospital in Ghana. Methods: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted from January to April 2015 at the Agona Swedru Municipal Hospital. Sixty (60) persons with {T2DM} and 40 without were recruited and screened using appropriate protocols. Blood samples were collected for coagulation and biochemical tests. Demographic and clinical information were collected using pre-tested questionnaire. Data was analyzed with {GraphPad} Prism version 5. Results: {APTT} and {PT} were significantly shorter among patients with {T2DM} compared to those without (20.88 ± 5.19 v 31.23 ± 5.41, P=0.0001; and 11.03 ± 2.06sec v 14.46 ± 1.86, P=0.0001 respectively). {INR} was decreased among patients with {T2DM} compared to those without (0.83 ± 0.18 v 1.13 ± 0.17, P=0.0001). No significant difference was found in platelet count between {T2DM} and non-diabetics (179.85 ± 66.15×103 /mm3 v 168.55 ± 35.77×103 /mm3, P=0.326). Serum magnesium was lower among the {T2DM} patients compared to the non-diabetics, while serum ionized calcium was significantly higher among the {T2DM} patients (P\textless 0.05). Conclusion: Clients with {T2DM} may have a high coagulation risk evidenced by shortened {APTT}, {PT} and a high ionized calcium compared with controls. Funding: Study was funded by Lord Ampomah and Solomon Panford.}

However, little research has been undertaken to define the environmental and physiological changes that cause S. aureus to shift from commensal to pathogenic organism in this setting. The ability of virus-driven danger signals to cause S. aureus to transition from commensalism to pulmonary infection was explored in a recent study by Reddinger et al. R. M. Reddinger, N. R. Luke-Marshall, A. P. Hakansson, and A. A. Campagnari, {mBio} 7(6):e01235-16, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/{mBio}.01235-16 The authors report that physiological host changes, including febrile temperature and a combination of host stress response signals, caused S. aureus biofilms to disperse from the nasal environment and cause active pulmonary infection. This commentary discusses the new finding in light of the current understanding of the mechanisms behind staphylococcal coinfection with {IAV}. In addition, it considers the mechanisms behind staphylococcal dispersal in this model. Overall, the study indicates that interkingdom signaling may occur following {IAV} infection and this likely contributes to sensitizing the {IAV}-infected host to secondary staphylococcal pneumonia.

It has been proposed as a dietary treatment that would produce similar benefits to fasting, which is already recorded in the Hippocratic collection. The {KD} has a high fat content (90\%) and low protein and carbohydrate. Evidence shows that {KD} and its variants are a good alternative for non-surgical pharmacoresistant patients with epilepsy of any age, taking into account that the type of diet should be designed individually and that less-restrictive and more-palatable diets are usually better options for adults and adolescents. This review discusses the {KD}, including the possible mechanisms of action, applicability, side effects, and evidence for its efficacy, and for the more-palatable diets such as the Modified Atkins Diet ({MAD}) and the Low Glycemic Index Diet ({LGID}) in children and adults.}

abstract = {At present, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, is increasing. Although the mechanism of the underlying pathology is not fully uncovered, in the last years, there has been significant progress in its understanding. This includes: Progressive deposition of amyloid \beta-peptides in amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in intracellular as neurofibrillary tangles; neuronal loss; and impaired glucose metabolism. Due to a lack of effective prevention and treatment strategy, emerging evidence suggests that dietary and metabolic interventions could potentially target these issues. The ketogenic diet is a very high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, which has a fasting-like effect bringing the body into a state of ketosis. The presence of ketone bodies has a neuroprotective impact on aging brain cells. Moreover, their production may enhance mitochondrial function, reduce the expression of inflammatory and apoptotic mediators. Thus, it has gained interest as a potential therapy for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. This review aims to examine the role of the ketogenic diet in Alzheimer's disease progression and to outline specific aspects of the nutritional profile providing a rationale for the implementation of dietary interventions as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.}

abstract = {During several months of 2003, a newly identified illness termed severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) spread rapidly through the world. A new coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) was identified as the {SARS} pathogen, which triggered severe pneumonia and acute, often lethal, lung failure. Moreover, among infected individuals influenza such as the Spanish flu and the emergence of new respiratory disease viruses have caused high lethality resulting from acute lung failure. In cell lines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) has been identified as a potential {SARS}-{CoV} receptor. The high lethality of {SARS}-{CoV} infections, its enormous economic and social impact, fears of renewed outbreaks as well as the potential misuse of such viruses as biologic weapons make it paramount to understand the pathogenesis of {SARS}-{CoV}. Here we provide the first genetic proof that {ACE2} is a crucial {SARS}-{CoV} receptor in vivo. {SARS}-{CoV} infections and the Spike protein of the {SARS}-{CoV} reduce {ACE2} expression. Notably, injection of {SARS}-{CoV} Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo that can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway. These results provide a molecular explanation why {SARS}-{CoV} infections cause severe and often lethal lung failure and suggest a rational therapy for {SARS} and possibly other respiratory disease viruses.}

abstract = {Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. Owing to the widespread use of antihypertensive medications, global mean blood pressure ({BP}) has remained constant or has decreased slightly over the past four decades. By contrast, the prevalence of hypertension has increased, especially in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}). Estimates suggest that 31.1\% of adults (1.39 billion) worldwide had hypertension in 2010. The prevalence of hypertension among adults was higher in {LMICs} (31.5\%, 1.04 billion people) than in high-income countries (28.5\%, 349 million people). Variations in the levels of risk factors for hypertension, such as high sodium intake, low potassium intake, obesity, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet, may explain some of the regional heterogeneity in hypertension prevalence. Despite the increasing prevalence, the proportions of hypertension awareness, treatment and {BP} control are low, particularly in {LMICs}, and few comprehensive assessments of the economic impact of hypertension exist. Future studies are warranted to test implementation strategies for hypertension prevention and control, especially in low-income populations, and to accurately assess the prevalence and financial burden of hypertension worldwide.}

abstract = {In recent decades, large increases in diabetes prevalence have been demonstrated in virtually all regions of the world. The increase in the number of people with diabetes or with a longer duration of diabetes is likely to alter the disease profile in many populations around the globe, particularly due to a higher incidence of diabetes-specific complications, such as kidney failure and peripheral arterial disease. The epidemiology of other conditions frequently associated with diabetes, including infections and cardiovascular disease, may also change, with direct effects on quality of life, demands on health services and economic costs. The current understanding of the international burden of and variation in diabetes-related complications is poor. The available data suggest that rates of myocardial infarction, stroke and amputation are decreasing among people with diabetes, in parallel with declining mortality. However, these data predominantly come from studies in only a few high-income countries. Trends in other complications of diabetes, such as end-stage renal disease, retinopathy and cancer, are less well explored. In this review, we synthesise data from population-based studies on trends in diabetes complications, with the objectives of: (1) characterising recent and long-term trends in diabetes-related complications; (2) describing regional variation in the excess risk of complications, where possible; and (3) identifying and prioritising gaps for future surveillance and study.}

abstract = {Different families of endogenous lectins use complementary defense strategies against pathogens. They may recognize non-self glycans typically found on pathogens and/or host glycans. The collectin and galectin families are prominent examples of these two lectin categories. Collectins are C-type lectins that contain a carbohydrate recognition domain and a collagen-like domain. Members of this group include surfactant protein A ({SP}-A) and D ({SP}-D), secreted by the alveolar epithelium to the alveolar fluid. Lung collectins bind to several microorganisms, which results in pathogen aggregation and/or killing, and enhances phagocytosis of pathogens by alveolar macrophages. Moreover, {SP}-A and {SP}-D influence macrophage responses, contributing to resolution of inflammation, and {SP}-A is essential for tissue-repair functions of macrophages. Galectins also function by interacting directly with pathogens or by modulating the immune system in response to the infection. Direct binding may result in enhanced or impaired infection of target cells, or can have microbicidal effects. Immunomodulatory effects of galectins include recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, promotion of neutrophil function, and stimulation of the bactericidal activity of infected macrophages. Moreover, intracellular galectins can serve as danger receptors, promoting autophagy of the invading pathogen. This review will focus on the role of collectins and galectins in pathogen clearance and immune response activation in infectious diseases of the respiratory system.}

After adjustment for confounders, overweight/obesity was associated with an elevated ratio of plasma Ang {II} to Ang-(1-7) (\beta: 0.57, 95\% {CI} 0.23-0.91) and higher Ang {II} (\beta: 0.21 pmol/L, 95\% {CI} 0.03-0.39) but lower Ang-(1-7) (\beta: -0.37 pmol/L, 95\% {CI} -0.7 to -0.04). Overweight/obesity was associated with a higher ratio of urinary Ang {II} to Ang-(1-7) (\beta: 0.21, 95\% {CI} -0.02 to 0.44), an effect that approached statistical significance. {CONCLUSIONS}: Among preterm-born adolescents, overweight/obesity was associated with increased Ang {II} but reduced Ang-(1-7) in the circulation and the kidney as well as higher blood pressure. Obesity may compound the increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in individuals born prematurely by further augmenting the prematurity-associated imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system.

As a consequence of the 2009 {H1N1} influenza A virus pandemic, obesity was identified for the first time as a risk factor for increased disease severity and mortality in infected individuals. Over-nutrition that results in obesity causes a chronic state of meta-inflammation with systemic implications for immunity. Obese hosts exhibit delayed and blunted antiviral responses to influenza virus infection, and they experience poor recovery from the disease. Furthermore, the efficacy of antivirals and vaccines is reduced in this population and obesity may also play a role in altering the viral life cycle, thus complementing the already weakened immune response and leading to severe pathogenesis. Case studies and basic research in human cohorts and animal models have highlighted the prolonged viral shed in the obese host, as well as a microenvironment that permits the emergence of virulent minor variants. This review focuses on influenza A virus pathogenesis in the obese host, and on the impact of obesity on the antiviral response, viral shed, and viral evolution. We comprehensively analyze the recent literature on how and why viral pathogenesis is altered in the obese host along with the impact of the altered host and pathogenic state on viral evolutionary dynamics in multiple models. Finally, we summarized the effectiveness of current vaccines and antivirals in this populations and the questions that remain to be answered. If current trends continue, nearly 50\% of the worldwide population is projected to be obese by 2050. This population will have a growing impact on both non-communicable and communicable diseases and may affect global evolutionary trends of influenza virus.}

abstract = {Following the 2009 {H1N1} influenza virus pandemic, numerous studies identified the striking link between diabetes mellitus and influenza disease severity. Typically, influenza virus is a self-limiting infection but in individuals who have a pre-existing chronic illness, such as diabetes mellitus, severe influenza can develop. Here, we discuss the latest clinical and experimental evidence for the role of diabetes in predisposing the host to severe influenza. We explore the possible mechanisms that underlie this synergy and highlight the, as yet, unexplored role that blood glucose oscillations may play in disease development. Diabetes is one of the world's fastest growing chronic diseases and influenza virus represents a constant and pervasive threat to human health. It is therefore imperative that we understand how diabetes increases influenza severity in order to mitigate the burden of future influenza epidemics and pandemics.}

The role of {HIF} stabilization during hypoxia has been extended from the induction of a single gene erythropoietin to the upregulation of a couple of hundred downstream targets, which demonstrates the complexity and importance of the {HIF} signaling pathway. Accordingly, {HIF} and its downstream targets are emerging as novel therapeutic options to treat various organ injuries. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of {HIF} signaling in four different organ systems, including the heart, lung, liver, and kidney. We also discuss the divergent roles of {HIF} in acute and chronic disease conditions and their revealed functions. Finally, we introduce some of the efforts that are being performed to translate our current knowledge in hypoxia signaling to clinical medicine.}

abstract = {Enveloped viruses need to fuse with a host cell membrane in order to deliver their genome into the host cell. While some viruses fuse with the plasma membrane, many viruses are endocytosed prior to fusion. Specific cues in the endosomal microenvironment induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to viral and host membrane fusion. In the present study we investigated the entry of coronaviruses ({CoVs}). Using {siRNA} gene silencing, we found that proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion profoundly promote infection of cells with mouse hepatitis coronavirus ({MHV}). Using recombinant {MHVs} expressing reporter genes as well as a novel, replication-independent fusion assay we confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and demonstrated that trafficking of {MHV} to lysosomes is required for fusion and productive entry to occur. Nevertheless, {MHV} was shown to be less sensitive to perturbation of endosomal {pH} than vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus, which fuse in early and late endosomes, respectively. Our results indicate that entry of {MHV} depends on proteolytic processing of its fusion protein S by lysosomal proteases. Fusion of {MHV} was severely inhibited by a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, while trafficking of {MHV} to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases was no longer required when a furin cleavage site was introduced in the S protein immediately upstream of the fusion peptide. Also entry of feline {CoV} was shown to depend on trafficking to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases. In contrast, {MERS}-{CoV}, which contains a minimal furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide, was negatively affected by inhibition of furin, but not of lysosomal proteases. We conclude that a proteolytic cleavage site in the {CoV} S protein directly upstream of the fusion peptide is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of fusion.}

Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 have been reported in detail. However, the relationship between {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p \textless  0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products ({FDP}), and fibrinogen ({FIB}) in all {SARS}-{CoV}-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and {FDP} values in patients with severe {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity ({PT}-act) was lower in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical {SARS}-{CoV}-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and {FDP} values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.}

These three components act cooperatively to clear inhaled pathogens, allergens and particulate matter without inducing inflammation and maintain tissue homeostasis. Therefore impairment of one or more of these essential components of barrier function may increase susceptibility to infection and promote exaggerated and prolonged innate immune responses to environmental factors including allergens and pathogens resulting in chronic inflammation.

Two-dimensional images of the S, M, and N structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and two other coronaviruses were refined to a resolution of approximately 4 nm. Proteins near the viral membrane were arranged in overlapping lattices surrounding a disordered core. Trimeric glycoprotein spikes were in register with four underlying ribonucleoprotein densities. However, the spikes were dispensable for ribonucleoprotein lattice formation. The ribonucleoprotein particles displayed coiled shapes when released from the viral membrane.

Hyperglycemia has been associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients, especially critically ill patients; these poor outcomes are explained in part by hospital-associated infections. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: {PubMed}, {EMBASE} and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies published between 1970 and 2014 reporting short-term effects of hyperglycemia on the innate immune system. {MeSH} database search terms included hyperglycemia, immune system, inflammation, inflammation mediators, neutrophils, endothelial dysfunction, complement system proteins and diabetes. Pertinent articles reported studies in healthy volunteers and diabetic patients, using in vitro laboratory experiments, and with animal models. {RESULTS}: Hyperglycemia activates protein kinase C, and this inhibits neutrophil migration, phagocytosis, superoxide production and microbial killing. High glucose concentrations decrease the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Hyperglycemia can also induce Toll-like receptor expression and inhibit neutrophil function and apoptosis. High glucose concentrations decrease vascular dilation and increase permeability during the initial inflammatory responses, possibly through protein kinase C activation. Hyperglycemia can cause direct glycosylation of proteins and alter the tertiary structure of complement; these changes inhibit immunoglobulin-mediated opsonization of bacteria and complement fixation to bacteria and decreases phagocytosis. Hyperglycemia also stimulates the production and release of cytokines. Several trials have demonstrated that better glycemic control reduces nosocomial infections in critically ill patients and surgical site infections. {CONCLUSIONS}: In summary, acute hyperglycemia can significantly alter innate immune responses to infection, and this potentially explains some of the poor outcomes in hospitalized patients who develop hyperglycemia.

Epidemiological studies identified diabetes as the primary comorbidity associated with severe or lethal {MERS}-{CoV} infection. Understanding how diabetes affects {MERS} is important because of the global burden of diabetes and pandemic potential of {MERS}-{CoV}. We used a model in which mice were made susceptible to {MERS}-{CoV} by expressing human {DPP4}, and type 2 diabetes was induced by administering a high-fat diet. Upon infection with {MERS}-{CoV}, diabetic mice had a prolonged phase of severe disease and delayed recovery that was independent of virus titers. Histological analysis revealed that diabetic mice had delayed inflammation, which was then prolonged through 21 days after infection. Diabetic mice had fewer inflammatory monocyte/macrophages and {CD4}+ T cells, which correlated with lower levels of Ccl2 and Cxcl10 expression. Diabetic mice also had lower levels of Tnfa, Il6, Il12b, and Arg1 expression and higher levels of Il17a expression. These data suggest that the increased disease severity observed in individuals with {MERS} and comorbid type 2 diabetes is likely due to a dysregulated immune response, which results in more severe and prolonged lung pathology.}

In addition, the use of oral ketogenic compounds, fractionated coconut oil, very low carbohydrate intake, or ketone monoester supplementation has been reported to be potentially helpful in mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autistic spectrum disorder. In these and other neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders, there are detrimental effects of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation on neuronal function. However, they also adversely impact on neurone-glia interactions, disrupting the role of microglia and astrocytes in central nervous system ({CNS}) homeostasis. Astrocytes are the main site of {CNS} fatty acid oxidation; the resulting ketone bodies constitute an important source of oxidative fuel for neurones in an environment of glucose restriction. Importantly, the lactate shuttle between astrocytes and neurones is dependent on glycogenolysis and glycolysis, resulting from the fact that the astrocytic filopodia responsible for lactate release are too narrow to accommodate mitochondria. The entry into the {CNS} of ketone bodies and fatty acids, as a result of nutritional ketosis, has effects on the astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle, glutamate synthase activity, and on the function of vesicular glutamate transporters, {EAAT}, Na+, K+-{ATPase}, Kir4.1, aquaporin-4, Cx34 and {KATP} channels, as well as on astrogliosis. These mechanisms are detailed and it is suggested that they would tend to mitigate the changes seen in many neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders. Hence, it is hypothesized that nutritional ketosis may have therapeutic applications in such disorders.}

abstract = {As coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) spreads across the world, the intensive care unit ({ICU}) community must prepare for the challenges associated with this pandemic. Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with {COVID}-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key. {ICU} practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce {ICU} resources might be needed. Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill. Copyright \copyright 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {The epicenter of the original outbreak in China has high male smoking rates of around 50\%, and early reported death rates have an emphasis on older males, therefore the likelihood of smokers being overrepresented in fatalities is high. In Iran, China, Italy, and South Korea, female smoking rates are much lower than males. Fewer females have contracted the virus. If this analysis is correct, then Indonesia would be expected to begin experiencing high rates of Covid-19 because its male smoking rate is over 60\% (Tobacco Atlas). Smokers are vulnerable to respiratory viruses. Smoking can upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ({ACE2}) receptor, the known receptor for both the severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS})-coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) and the human respiratory coronavirus {NL638}. This could also be true for new electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes and "heat-not-burn" {IQOS} devices. {ACE2} could be a novel adhesion molecule for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 causing Covid-19 and a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections, and therefore it should be fast tracked and prioritized for research and investigation. Data on smoking status should be collected on all identified cases of Covid-19.}

The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has not been fully documented. {METHODS}: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including {BMI}, and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation ({IMV}) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in a single French center. {RESULTS}: Obesity ({BMI} \textgreater 30) and severe obesity ({BMI} \textgreater 35) were present in 47.6\% and 28.2\% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6\%) required {IMV}. The proportion of patients who required {IMV} increased with {BMI} categories (P \textless  0.01, \chi2 test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with {BMI} \textgreater 35 (85.7\%). In multivariate logistic regression, the need for {IMV} was significantly associated with male sex (P \textless  0.05) and {BMI} (P \textless  0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. The odds ratio for {IMV} in patients with {BMI} \textgreater 35 versus patients with {BMI} \textless  25 was 7.36 (1.63-33.14; P = 0.02). {CONCLUSIONS}: The present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Disease severity increased with {BMI}. Obesity is a risk factor for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 severity, requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals. \copyright 2020 The Obesity Society.}

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: {COVID}-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. {METHODS}: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism ({PE}), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all {COVID}-19 patients admitted to the {ICU} of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. {RESULTS}: We studied 184 {ICU} patients with proven {COVID}-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13\%), 22 were discharged alive (12\%) and 139 (76\%) were still on the {ICU} on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31\% (95\%{CI} 20-41), of which {CTPA} and/or ultrasonography confirmed {VTE} in 27\% (95\%{CI} 17-37\%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7\% (95\%{CI} 0-8.2\%). {PE} was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81\%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio ({aHR}) 1.05/per year, 95\%{CI} 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time \textgreater 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time \textgreater 5 s ({aHR} 4.1, 95\%{CI} 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. {CONCLUSION}: The 31\% incidence of thrombotic complications in {ICU} patients with {COVID}-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all {COVID}-19 patients admitted to the {ICU}, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.

abstract = {Monocarboxylate transporter 4 ({MCT4}) is an H+-coupled symporter highly expressed in metastatic tumors and at inflammatory sites undergoing hypoxia or the Warburg effect. At these sites, extracellular lactate contributes to malignancy and immune response evasion. Intriguingly, at 30-40 mm, the reported Km of {MCT4} for lactate is more than 1 order of magnitude higher than physiological or even pathological lactate levels. {MCT4} is not thought to transport pyruvate. Here we have characterized cell lactate and pyruvate dynamics using the {FRET} sensors Laconic and Pyronic. Dominant {MCT4} permeability was demonstrated in various cell types by pharmacological means and by {CRISPR}/Cas9-mediated deletion. Respective Km values for lactate uptake were 1.7, 1.2, and 0.7 mm in {MDA}-{MB}-231 cells, macrophages, and {HEK293} cells expressing recombinant {MCT4}. In {MDA}-{MB}-231 cells {MCT4} exhibited a Km for pyruvate of 4.2 mm, as opposed to \textgreater150 mm reported previously. Parallel assays with the {pH}-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein ({BCECF}) indicated that previous Km estimates based on substrate-induced acidification were severely biased by confounding {pH}-regulatory mechanisms. Numerical simulation using revised kinetic parameters revealed that {MCT4}, but not the related transporters {MCT1} and {MCT2}, endows cells with the ability to export lactate in high-lactate microenvironments. In conclusion, {MCT4} is a high-affinity lactate transporter with physiologically relevant affinity for pyruvate. \copyright 2019 Contreras-Baeza et al.}

Previous studies have shown that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), which is the same as {SARS}-{CoV}. The expression and distribution of {ACE2} in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk {RNA}-seq and single-cell {RNA}-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of {ACE2} in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with {COVID}-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41\%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46\%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85\%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with {COVID}-19.

A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19). The World Health Organization ({WHO}) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of {COVID}-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat {COVID}-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about {COVID}-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of {COVID}-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of {COVID}-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the {US} Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) as a treatment for {COVID}-19.

abstract = {Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ({ACE2}) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: {SARS}-{CoV}, {NL63} and {SARS}-{CoV}-2. {ACE2} receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. {ACE2} is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble {ACE2} is the degradation of angiotensin {II} to angiotensin1-7. Consequently, {ACE2} receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin {II} to {AT1} receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of {SARS}-{CoV2} into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates {ACE2} receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin {II} effects via the {ACE}→Angiotensin {II}→{AT1} receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of {ACE2} deficiency. We suggest that {ACE2} down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline {ACE2} deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional {ACE2} deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the 'adverse' {ACE}→Angiotensin {II}→{AT1} receptor axis and the 'protective' {ACE2}→Angiotensin1-7→Mas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin {II} hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant {ACE2}, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin {II} type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) and concern for viral transmission by ambulatory patients with minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) infection. Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in {COVID}-19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases. {METHODS}: A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for {COVID}-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with {COVID}-19 positivity. {RESULTS}: A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent {COVID}-19 testing between March 3, 2020, and March 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58\%) {COVID}-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15\%) {COVID}-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68\% (40/59) and 71\% (42/59) of {COVID}-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16\% (33/203) and 17\% (35/203) of {COVID}-19-negative patients (p \textless 0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with {COVID}-19 positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [{aOR}] 10.9; 95\% {CI}, 5.08-23.5; ageusia: {aOR} 10.2; 95\% {CI}, 4.74-22.1), whereas sore throat was associated with {COVID}-19 negativity ({aOR} 0.23; 95\% {CI}, 0.11-0.50). Of patients who reported {COVID}-19-associated loss of smell, 74\% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness. {CONCLUSION}: In ambulatory individuals with influenza-like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with {COVID}-19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms. Most will recover chemosensory function within weeks, paralleling resolution of other disease-related symptoms. \copyright 2020 {ARS}-{AAOA}, {LLC}.}

abstract = {The widespread antigenic changes lead to the emergence of a new type of coronavirus ({CoV}) called as severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS})-{CoV}-2 that is immunologically different from the previous circulating species. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ({ACE}-2) is one of the most important receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells ({HCs}) which its interaction with spike protein ({SP}) with a furin-cleavage site results in the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 invasion. Hence, in this review, we presented an overview on the interaction of {ACE}-2 and furin with {SP}. As several kinds of {CoVs}, from various genera, have at their S1/S2 binding site a preserved site, we further surveyed the role of furin cleavage site ({FCS}) on the life cycle of the {CoV}. Furthermore, we discussed that the small molecular inhibitors can limit the interaction of {ACE}-2 and furin with {SP} and can be used as potential therapeutic platforms to combat the spreading {CoV} epidemic. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future prospects for the development of potential drugs to promote targeting specific activities of the {CoV} were reviewed. In conclusion, this review may pave the way for providing useful information about different compounds involved in improving the effectiveness of {CoV} vaccine or drugs with minimum toxicity against human health.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Four of these viruses can cause common cold-like symptoms, while others that infect animals can evolve and become infectious to humans. Three recent examples of this viral jumps include {SARS} {CoV}, {MERS}-{CoV} and {SARS} {CoV}-2 virus.

Latest figures from 14 April 2020 show more than 2 million people had been infected with the virus, causing more than 120,000 deaths in over 210 countries worldwide. The large amount of information we receive every day concerning this new disease is so abundant and dynamic that medical staff, health authorities, academics and the media are not able to keep up with this new pandemic.

The lack of prior immunity to {COVID}-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for {COVID}-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of {COVID}-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. {COVID}-19-associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or {DIC}. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with {COVID}-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with {DIC}, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of {DIC} and bleeding should be followed. \copyright 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.}

Thus, {ACE2} is the key to understanding the mechanism of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. This study is to investigate the {ACE2} expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. {METHODS}: We compared {ACE2} expression levels across 31 normal human tissues between males and females and between younger (ages ≤ 49 years) and older (ages \textgreater 49 years) persons using two-sided Student's t test. We also investigated the correlations between {ACE2} expression and immune signatures in various tissues using Pearson's correlation test. {RESULTS}: {ACE2} expression levels were the highest in the small intestine, testis, kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue, and were the lowest in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscle. {ACE2} showed medium expression levels in the lungs, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland. {ACE2} was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older persons in any tissue. In the skin, digestive system, brain, and blood vessels, {ACE2} expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females. In the thyroid and lungs, {ACE2} expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females, respectively, and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our data indicate that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs and infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally. The different host immune responses to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection may partially explain why males and females, young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity. This study provides new insights into the role of {ACE2} in the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic.}

abstract = {The mammalian lung´s structural design is optimized to serve its main function: gas exchange. It takes place in the alveolar region (parenchyma) where air and blood are brought in close proximity over a large surface. Air reaches the alveolar lumen via a conducting airway tree. Blood flows in a capillary network embedded in inter-alveolar septa. The barrier between air and blood consists of a continuous alveolar epithelium (a mosaic of type I and type {II} alveolar epithelial cells), a continuous capillary endothelium and the connective tissue layer in-between. By virtue of its respiratory movements, the lung has to withstand mechanical challenges throughout life. Alveoli must be protected from over-distension as well as from collapse by inherent stabilizing factors. The mechanical stability of the parenchyma is ensured by two components: a connective tissue fiber network and the surfactant system. The connective tissue fibers form a continuous tensegrity (tension + integrity) backbone consisting of axial, peripheral and septal fibers. Surfactant (surface active agent) is the secretory product of type {II} alveolar epithelial cells and covers the alveolar epithelium as a biophysically active thin and continuous film. Here, we briefly review the structural components relevant for gas exchange. Then we describe our current understanding of how these components function under normal conditions and how lung injury results in dysfunction of alveolar micromechanics finally leading to lung fibrosis.}

Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have been the most common risk factors for severity and mortality. The hyperinflammatory response of the body, coupled with the plausible direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome on body-wide organs via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, has been associated with complications of the disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock, and multiorgan failure have precipitated death. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of {COVID}-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients.

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes ({T2D}) is a major comorbidity of {COVID}-19. However, the impact of blood glucose ({BG}) control on the degree of required medical interventions and on mortality in patients with {COVID}-19 and {T2D} remains uncertain. Thus, we performed a retrospective, multi-centered study of 7,337 cases of {COVID}-19 in Hubei Province, China, among which 952 had pre-existing {T2D}. We found that subjects with {T2D} required more medical interventions and had a significantly higher mortality (7.8\% versus 2.7\%; adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}], 1.49) and multiple organ injury than the non-diabetic individuals. Further, we found that well-controlled {BG} (glycemic variability within 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) was associated with markedly lower mortality compared to individuals with poorly controlled {BG} (upper limit of glycemic variability exceeding 10.0 mmol/L) (adjusted {HR}, 0.14) during hospitalization. These findings provide clinical evidence correlating improved glycemic control with better outcomes in patients with {COVID}-19 and pre-existing {T2D}. Copyright \copyright 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, fully understanding the characteristics of {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} is conducive to early identification and precise treatment. We aimed to describe the characteristics of {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} and to elucidate the differences from {ARDS} caused by other factors. {COVID}-19 mainly affected the respiratory system with minor damage to other organs. Injury to the alveolar epithelial cells was the main cause of {COVID}-19-related {ARDS}, and endothelial cells were less damaged with therefore less exudation. The clinical manifestations were relatively mild in some {COVID}-19 patients, which was inconsistent with the severity of laboratory and imaging findings. The onset time of {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} was 8-12 days, which was inconsistent with {ARDS} Berlin criteria, which defined a 1-week onset limit. Some of these patients might have a relatively normal lung compliance. The severity was redefined into three stages according to its specificity: mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe. {HFNO} can be safe in {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} patients, even in some moderate-severe patients. The more likely cause of death is severe respiratory failure. Thus, the timing of invasive mechanical ventilation is very important. The effects of corticosteroids in {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} patients were uncertain. We hope to help improve the prognosis of severe cases and reduce the mortality.}

abstract = {Smokers have a significantly higher risk for developing coronary and cerebrovascular disease than nonsmokers. Advanced glycation end products ({AGEs}) are reactive, cross-linking moieties that form from the reaction of reducing sugars and the amino groups of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. {AGEs} circulate in high concentrations in the plasma of patients with diabetes or renal insufficiency and have been linked to the accelerated vasculopathy seen in patients with these diseases. Because the curing of tobacco takes place under conditions that could lead to the formation of glycation products, we examined whether tobacco and tobacco smoke could generate these reactive species that would increase {AGE} formation in vivo. Our findings show that reactive glycation products are present in aqueous extracts of tobacco and in tobacco smoke in a form that can rapidly react with proteins to form {AGEs}. This reaction can be inhibited by aminoguanidine, a known inhibitor of {AGE} formation. We have named these glycation products "glycotoxins." Like other known reducing sugars and reactive glycation products, glycotoxins form smoke, react with protein, exhibit a specific fluorescence when cross-linked to proteins, and are mutagenic. Glycotoxins are transferred to the serum proteins of human smokers. {AGE}-apolipoprotein B and serum {AGE} levels in cigarette smokers were significantly higher than those in nonsmokers. These results suggest that increased glycotoxin exposure may contribute to the increased incidence of atherosclerosis and high prevalence of cancer in smokers.}

abstract = {The coronavirus disease-19 pandemic ({COVID}-19), which appeared in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world, has forced clinicians and scientists to take up extraordinary challenges. This unprecedented situation led to the inception of numerous fundamental research protocols and many clinical trials. It quickly became apparent that although {COVID}-19, in the vast majority of cases, was a benign disease, it could also develop a severe form with sometimes fatal outcomes. Cytokines are central to the pathophysiology of {COVID}-19; while some of them are beneficial (type-I interferon, interleukin-7), others appear detrimental (interleukin-1\beta, -6, and {TNF}-\alpha) particularly in the context of the so-called cytokine storm. Yet another characteristic of the disease has emerged: concomitant immunodeficiency, notably involving impaired type-I interferon response, and lymphopenia. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on {COVID}-19 immunopathology. We discuss the defective type-I {IFN} response, the theoretical role of {IL}-7 to restore lymphocyte repertoire, as well as we mention the two patterns observed in severe {COVID}-19 (i.e. interleukin-1\beta-driven macrophage activation syndrome vs. interleukin-6-driven immune dysregulation). Next, reviewing current evidence drawn from clinical trials, we examine a number of cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, including interleukin-1, -6, and {TNF} inhibitors, as well as less targeted therapies, such as corticosteroids, chloroquine, or {JAK} inhibitors.

The heavily glycosylated {IBV} spike protein is responsible for binding to host tissues. Glycosylation sites in the spike protein are highly conserved across viral genotypes, suggesting an important role for this modification in the virus life cycle. Here, we analyzed the N-glycosylation of the receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) of {IBV} strain M41 spike protein and assessed the role of this modification in host receptor binding. Ten single Asn-to-Ala substitutions at the predicted N-glycosylation sites of the M41-{RBD} were evaluated along with two control Val-to-Ala substitutions. {CD} analysis revealed that the secondary structure of all variants was retained compared with the unmodified M41-{RBD} construct. Six of the 10 glycosylation variants lost binding to chicken trachea tissue and an {ELISA}-presented \alpha2,3-linked sialic acid oligosaccharide ligand. {LC}/{MSE} glycomics analysis revealed that glycosylation sites have specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Overall, the glycosylation patterns of most variant {RBDs} were highly similar to those of the unmodified M41-{RBD} construct. In silico docking experiments with the recently published cryo-{EM} structure of the M41 {IBV} spike protein and our glycosylation results revealed a potential ligand receptor site that is ringed by four glycosylation sites that dramatically impact ligand binding. Combined with the results of previous array studies, the glycosylation and mutational analyses presented here suggest a unique glycosylation-dependent binding modality for the M41 spike protein.}

The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with {COVID}-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities. {METHODS}: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with {COVID}-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. {RESULTS}: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median {BMI} was 30 kg/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76\%), hyperlipidemia (46.2\%), and diabetes (39.5\%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86\%), cough (76.5\%), and dyspnea (68\%) were the three most common symptoms. 24\% died during hospitalization ({BMI} \textless  25 kg/m2: 31.6\%, {BMI} 25-34 kg/m2: 17.2\%, {BMI} ≥ 35 kg/m2: 34.8\%, p = 0.03). Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, {BMI} ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: {BMI} 25-34 kg/m2), heart failure, {CAD}, and {CKD} or {ESRD} were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that {BMI} ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: {BMI} 25-34 kg/m2, {OR}: 3.78; 95\% {CI}: 1.45-9.83; p = 0.006), male sex ({OR}: 2.74; 95\% {CI}: 1.25-5.98; p = 0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, {OR}: 1.73; 95\% {CI}: 1.13-2.63; p = 0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Similarly, age, male sex, {BMI} ≥ 35 kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and {BMI} ≥ 35 kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.

Although the ketogenic diet ({KD}) has been reported to be effective in treating of {SRSE}, the use of the diet as therapy can be complicated by concomitant medical problems specific to critically ill patients. In this study, we aimed to describe our experience of the {KD} for {SRSE} patients in {ICUs}. {METHODS}: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 16 patients (10 males, 6 females) with {SRSE} who were treated with the {KD} in the {ICUs} at Samsung Medical Center from July 2005 to July 2017. {RESULTS}: The median age of seizure onset was 8 years (interquartile range 5-13.5). Prior to diet initiation, the patients were in convulsive or non-convulsive {SRSE} for a median of 23 days (range, 3-420). The median time to achieve ketosis was 3 days (range, 2-6). The {KD} was continued for a median of 2.1 months (range, 0.1-15.8). Of the 16 patients, nine (56.3\%) achieved seizure freedom, six (37.5\%) reported \textgreater50\% seizure reduction, and one (6.2\%) had \textless 50\% seizure improvement after the {KD}. There was no significant change in the number of antiepileptic drugs. The most commonly encountered complication during the {KD} was gastrointestinal disturbance. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our experience indicates that the {KD} is an effective alternative therapeutic strategy for {SRSE} patients in {ICUs} with adequate efficacy and safety in reducing seizure frequency and weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation, although functional outcome was not favorable for most patients. Close monitoring and preventive management of potential adverse effects are critical elements for success with the {KD} in patients with {SRSE}.

Patients in intensive care unit with stress hyperglycemia have significantly higher mortality (31\%) compared to patients with previously confirmed diabetes (10\%) or normoglycemia (11.3\%). Stress hyperglycemia is associated with increased risk of critical illness polyneuropathy ({CIP}) and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Intensive monitoring and insulin therapy according to the protocol are an important part of the treatment of critically ill patients. {OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate the incidence of stress hyperglycemia, complications and outcome in critically ill patients in our Medical intensive care unit. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: This study included 100 patients hospitalized in Medical intensive care unit during the period January 2014-March 2015 which were divided into three groups: Diabetes mellitus, stress-hyperglycemia and normoglycemia. During the retrospective-prospective observational clinical investigation the following data was obtained: age, gender, {SAPS}, admission diagnosis, average daily blood glucose, highest blood glucose level, glycemic variability, vasopressor and corticosteroid therapy, days on mechanical ventilation, total days of hospitalization in Medical intensive care unit, and outcome. {RESULTS}: Patients with {DM} treated with a continuous insulin infusion did not have significantly more complications than patients with normoglycemia, unlike patients with stress hyperglycemia, which had more severe prognosis. There was a significant difference between the maximum level of blood glucose in recovered and patients with adverse outcome (p = 0.0277). Glycemic variability (difference between max. and min. blood glucose) was the strongest predictor of adverse outcome. The difference in glycemic variability between the stress-hyperglycemia and normoglycemic group was statistically significant (p = 0.0066). There was no statistically significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation and total days of hospitalization in the intensive care unit between the groups. {CONCLUSION}: Understanding of the objectives of glucose regulation and effective glycemic control is essential for the proper optimization of patient outcomes.}

The {ACE}-2 receptor is a part of the dual system renin-angiotensin-system ({RAS}) consisting of {ACE}-Ang-{II}-{AT1R} axis and {ACE}-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. In metabolic disorders and with increased age, it is known that there is an upregulation of {ACE}-Ang-{II}-{AT1R} axis with a downregulation of {ACE}-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. The activated {ACE}-Ang-{II}-{AT1R} axis leads to pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in respiratory system, vascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, and insulin secretory defects with increased insulin resistance. On the other hand, the {ACE}-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on the respiratory system and anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and protective effects on vascular function, protects against myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, pancreatitis, and insulin resistance. In effect, the balance between these two axes may determine the prognosis. The already strained {ACE}-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas in metabolic disorders is further stressed due to the use of the {ACE}-2 by the virus for entry, which affects the prognosis in terms of respiratory compromise. Further evidence needs to be gathered on whether modulation of the renin angiotensin system would be advantageous due to upregulation of Mas activation or harmful due to the concomitant {ACE}-2 receptor upregulation in the acute management of {COVID}-19. \copyright Georg Thieme Verlag {KG} Stuttgart · New York.}

There is a paucity of information on glycemic control among hospitalized {COVID}-19 patients with diabetes and acute hyperglycemia. {METHODS}: This retrospective observational study of laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19 adults evaluated glycemic and clinical outcomes in patients with and without diabetes and/or acutely uncontrolled hyperglycemia hospitalized March 1 to April 6, 2020. Diabetes was defined as {A1C} ≥6.5\%. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia was defined as ≥2 blood glucoses ({BGs}) \textgreater 180 mg/{dL} within any 24-hour period. Data were abstracted from Glytec's data warehouse. {RESULTS}: Among 1122 patients in 88 U.S. hospitals, 451 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia spent 37.8\% of patient days having a mean {BG} \textgreater 180 mg/{dL}. Among 570 patients who died or were discharged, the mortality rate was 28.8\% in 184 diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients, compared with 6.2\% of 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (P \textless .001).

Among 493 discharged survivors, median length of stay ({LOS}) was longer in 184 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia compared with 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (5.7 vs 4.3 days, P \textless .001). {CONCLUSION}: Among hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19, diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia occurred frequently. These {COVID}-19 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a longer {LOS} and markedly higher mortality than patients without diabetes or uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a particularly high mortality rate. We recommend health systems which ensure that inpatient hyperglycemia is safely and effectively treated.}

abstract = {Angiotensin Converting Enzyme2 is the cell surface binding site for the coronavirus {SARS}-{CoV}-2, which causes {COVID}-19. We propose that an imbalance in the action of {ACE1}- and {ACE2}-derived peptides, thereby enhancing angiotensin {II} (Ang {II}) signalling is primary driver of {COVID}-19 pathobiology. {ACE1}/{ACE2} imbalance occurs due to the binding of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to {ACE2}, reducing {ACE2}-mediated conversion of Ang {II} to Ang peptides that counteract pathophysiological effects of {ACE1}-generated {ANG} {II}. This hypothesis suggests several approaches to treat {COVID}-19 by restoring {ACE1}/{ACE2} balance: (a) {AT} receptor antagonists; (b) {ACE1} inhibitors ({ACEIs}); (iii) agonists of receptors activated by {ACE2}-derived peptides (e.g. Ang (1-7), which activates {MAS1}); (d) recombinant human {ACE2} or {ACE2} peptides as decoys for the virus. Reducing {ACE1}/{ACE2} imbalance is predicted to blunt {COVID}-19-associated morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable patients. Importantly, approved {AT} antagonists and {ACEIs} can be rapidly repurposed to test their efficacy in treating {COVID}-19. {LINKED} {ARTICLES}: This article is part of a themed issue on The Pharmacology of {COVID}-19.

abstract = {People with diabetes are two times more likely to die from influenza than people with no underlying medical condition. The mechanisms underlying this susceptibility are poorly understood. In healthy individuals, small and short-lived postprandial peaks in blood glucose levels occur. In diabetes mellitus, these fluctuations become greater and more frequent. This glycemic variability is associated with oxidative stress and hyperinflammation. However, the contribution of glycemic variability to the pathogenesis of influenza A virus ({IAV}) has not been explored. Here, we used an in vitro model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier and novel murine models to investigate the role of glycemic variability in influenza severity. In vitro, a history of glycemic variability significantly increased influenza-driven cell death and destruction of the epithelial-endothelial barrier. In vivo, influenza virus-infected mice with a history of glycemic variability lost significantly more body weight than mice with constant blood glucose levels. This increased disease severity was associated with markers of oxidative stress and hyperinflammation both in vitro and in vivo Together, these results provide the first indication that glycemic variability may help drive the increased risk of severe influenza in people with diabetes mellitus.{IMPORTANCE} Every winter, people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe influenza. At present, the mechanisms that cause this increased susceptibility are unclear. Here, we show that the fluctuations in blood glucose levels common in people with diabetes are associated with severe influenza. These data suggest that glycemic stability could become a greater clinical priority for patients with diabetes during outbreaks of influenza. Copyright \copyright 2020 Marshall et al.}

abstract = {Multiple organ damage in severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) patients is common; however, the pathogenesis remains controversial. This study was to determine whether the damage was correlated with expression of the {SARS} coronavirus receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), in different organs, especially in the endocrine tissues of the pancreas, and to elucidate the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in {SARS} patients. The effect of clinical variables on survival was estimated in 135 {SARS} patients who died, 385 hospitalized {SARS} patients who survived, and 19 patients with non-{SARS} pneumonia. A total of 39 {SARS} patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment were compared to 39 matched healthy siblings during a 3-year follow-up period. The pattern of {SARS} coronavirus receptor-{ACE2} proteins in different human organs was also studied. Significant elevations in oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase {MB} isoenzyme, and fasting plasma glucose ({FPG}), but not in alanine transaminase were predictors for death. Abundant {ACE2} immunostaining was found in lung, kidney, heart, and islets of pancreas, but not in hepatocytes. Twenty of the 39 followed-up patients were diabetic during hospitalization. After 3 years, only two of these patients had diabetes. Compared with their non-{SARS} siblings, these patients exhibited no significant differences in {FPG}, postprandial glucose ({PPG}), and insulin levels. The organ involvements of {SARS} correlated with organ expression of {ACE2}. The localization of {ACE2} expression in the endocrine part of the pancreas suggests that {SARS} coronavirus enters islets using {ACE2} as its receptor and damages islets causing acute diabetes.}

Blood glucose level is an important risk factor for the prognosis of infection and critically ill patients. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of blood glucose level in patients with {COVID}-19. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: We collected clinical and survival information of 2041 consecutive hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19 from two medical centers in Wuhan. Patients without available blood glucose level were excluded. We performed multivariable Cox regression to calculate {HRs} of blood glucose-associated indexes for the risk of progression to critical cases/mortality among non-critical cases, as well as in-hospital mortality in critical cases. Sensitivity analysis were conducted in patient without diabetes. {RESULTS}: Elevation of admission blood glucose level was an independent risk factor for progression to critical cases/death among non-critical cases ({HR}=1.30, 95\% {CI} 1.03 to 1.63, p=0.026). Elevation of initial blood glucose level of critical diagnosis was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in critical cases ({HR}=1.84, 95\% {CI} 1.14 to 2.98, p=0.013). Higher median glucose level during hospital stay or after critical diagnosis (≥6.1 mmol/L) was independently associated with increased risks of progression to critical cases/death among non-critical cases, as well as in-hospital mortality in critical cases. Above results were consistent in the sensitivity analysis in patients without diabetes. {CONCLUSIONS}: Elevation of blood glucose level predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19. Our findings may provide a simple and practical way to risk stratify {COVID}-19 inpatients for hierarchical management, particularly where medical resources are in severe shortage during the pandemic. \copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

abstract = {Hypertension and type 2 diabetes are common comorbidities. Hypertension is twice as frequent in patients with diabetes compared with those who do not have diabetes. Moreover, patients with hypertension often exhibit insulin resistance and are at greater risk of diabetes developing than are normotensive individuals. The major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes is cardiovascular disease, which is exacerbated by hypertension. Accordingly, diabetes and hypertension are closely interlinked because of similar risk factors, such as endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, arterial remodelling, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, and obesity. There is also substantial overlap in the cardiovascular complications of diabetes and hypertension related primarily to microvascular and macrovascular disease. Common mechanisms, such as upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress, inflammation, and activation of the immune system likely contribute to the close relationship between diabetes and hypertension. In this article we discuss diabetes and hypertension as comorbidities and discuss the pathophysiological features of vascular complications associated with these conditions. We also highlight some vascular mechanisms that predispose to both conditions, focusing on advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, inflammation, the immune system, and {microRNAs}. Finally, we provide some insights into current therapies targeting diabetes and cardiovascular complications and introduce some new agents that may have vasoprotective therapeutic potential in diabetes.

It remained to be determined why diabetic individuals with uncontrolled glucose levels are more prone to develop the severe form of {COVID}-19. The molecular mechanism underlying {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and what determines the onset of the cytokine storm found in severe {COVID}-19 patients are unknown. Monocytes/macrophages are the most enriched immune cell types in the lungs of {COVID}-19 patients and appear to have a central role in the pathogenicity of the disease. These cells adapt their metabolism upon infection and become highly glycolytic, which facilitates {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication. The infection triggers mitochondrial {ROS} production, which induces stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1\alpha ({HIF} - 1\alpha) and consequently promotes glycolysis. {HIF}- 1\alpha-induced changes in monocyte metabolism by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection directly inhibit T cell response and reduce epithelial cell survival.

The majority of patients with {COVID}-19 had diabetes mellitus ({DM}) (62.0\%), Pre-{DM} (23.9\%) with elevated fasting blood glucose ({FBG}), or a body mass index \textgreater30 with normal hemoglobin A1c ({HbA1C}) (4.3\%). {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal {HbA1C} levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with {DM} as compared with non-diabetics. Severe {COVID}-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with {DM}, {preDM}, and obesity. {COVID}-19 is associated with elevated {FBG} and several patients presented with new onset {DM} or in {DKA}.

To investigate the expression level of these {SARS}-{CoV}-2 host cell entry genes in the lung airway, we used public gene expression datasets. We have found a differential expression of {ACE2} and {TMPR\SS2} in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of {COVID}-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both {ACE2} and {TMPR\SS2} was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared with non-smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) compared with healthy subjects. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of {ACE2} and {TMPR\SS2} between children and adults, or in {COPD} or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension, whereas only {ACE2} was upregulated in the blood of asthmatics. These results suggest that the observed difference in {COVID}-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in {ACE2} and {TMPR\SS2} airways tissue expression levels. \copyright 2020 The Authors.}

abstract = {Objective: Clinical and laboratory biomarkers to predict the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) are essential in this pandemic situation of which resource allocation must be urgently prepared especially in the context of respiratory support readiness. Lymphocyte count has been a marker of interest since the first {COVID}-19 publication. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association of lymphocyte count on admission and the severity of {COVID}-19. We would also like to analyze whether patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities affect the relationship between lymphocyte count and {COVID}-19. Methods: Comprehensive and systematic literature search was performed from {PubMed}, {SCOPUS}, {EuropePMC}, {ProQuest}, Cochrane Central Databases, and Google Scholar. Research articles in adult patients diagnosed with {COVID}-19 with information on lymphocyte count and several outcomes of interest, including mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}), intensive care unit ({ICU}) care, and severe {COVID}-19, were included in the analysis. Inverse variance method was used to obtain mean differences and its standard deviations. Maentel-Haenszel formula was used to calculate dichotomous variables to obtain odds ratios ({ORs}) along with its 95\% confidence intervals. Random-effect models were used for meta-analysis regardless of heterogeneity. Restricted-maximum likelihood random-effects meta-regression was performed for age, gender, cardiac comorbidity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, {COPD}, and smoking. Results: There were a total of 3099 patients from 24 studies. Meta-analysis showed that patients with poor outcome have a lower lymphocyte count (mean difference - 361.06 μL [- 439.18, - 282.95], p \textless 0.001; I2 84\%) compared to those with good outcome. Subgroup analysis showed lower lymphocyte count in patients who died (mean difference - 395.35 μL [- 165.64, - 625.07], p \textless 0.001; I2 87\%), experienced {ARDS} (mean difference - 377.56 μL [- 271.89, - 483.22], p \textless 0.001; I2 0\%), received {ICU} care (mean difference - 376.53 μL [- 682.84, - 70.22], p = 0.02; I2 89\%), and have severe {COVID}-19 (mean difference - 353.34 μL [- 250.94, - 455.73], p \textless 0.001; I2 85\%). Lymphopenia was associated with severe {COVID}-19 ({OR} 3.70 [2.44, 5.63], p \textless 0.001; I2 40\%). Meta-regression showed that the association between lymphocyte count and composite poor outcome was affected by age (p = 0.034). Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that lymphopenia on admission was associated with poor outcome in patients with {COVID}-19. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The leading cause of acute illnesses, respiratory viruses, typically cause self-limited diseases, although severe complications can occur in fragile patients. Rhinoviruses ({RVs}), respiratory enteroviruses ({EVs}), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial viruses ({RSVs}), and coronaviruses are highly prevalent respiratory pathogens, but because of the lack of reliable animal models, their differential pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. {OBJECTIVE}: We sought to compare infections by respiratory viruses isolated from clinical specimens using reconstituted human airway epithelia. {METHODS}: Tissues were infected with {RV}-A55, {RV}-A49, {RV}-B48, {RV}-C8, and {RV}-C15; respiratory {EV}-D68; influenza virus {H3N2}; {RSV}-B; and human coronavirus ({HCoV})-{OC43}. Replication kinetics, cell tropism, effect on tissue integrity, and cytokine secretion were compared. Viral adaptation and tissue response were assessed through {RNA} sequencing. {RESULTS}: {RVs}, {RSV}-B, and {HCoV}-{OC43} infected ciliated cells and caused no major cell death, whereas {H3N2} and {EV}-D68 induced ciliated cell loss and tissue integrity disruption. {H3N2} was also detected in rare goblet and basal cells. All viruses, except {RV}-B48 and {HCoV}-{OC43}, altered cilia beating and mucociliary clearance. {H3N2} was the strongest cytokine inducer, and {HCoV}-{OC43} was the weakest. Persistent infection was observed in all cases. {RNA} sequencing highlighted perturbation of tissue metabolism and induction of a transient but important immune response at 4 days after infection. No majority mutations emerged in the viral population. {CONCLUSION}: Our results highlight the differential in vitro pathogenesis of respiratory viruses during the acute infection phase and their ability to persist under immune tolerance. These data help to appreciate the range of disease severity observed in vivo and the occurrence of chronic respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts.

There is increasing evidence that olfactory dysfunction can present in {COVID}-19 patients. Anosmia can occur alone or can be accompanied by other symptoms of {COVID}-19, such as a dry cough. However, the pathogenic mechanism of olfactory dysfunction and its clinical characteristics in patients with {COVID}-19 remains unclear. Multiple cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that the incidence rate of olfactory dysfunction in {COVID}-19 patients varies from 33.9-68\% with female dominance. Anosmia and dysgeusia are often comorbid in {COVID}-19 patients. Otolaryngologists should be mindful of the symptom of anosmia in outpatients so as not to delay the diagnosis of {COVID}-19.

At the same time, {ACE} 2 expression decreases during {COVID}-19. Two seemingly contradictory relationships between the expression of {ACE} 2 and {COVID}-19 have been reported. Increased level of expression of {ACE} 2 may be a risk factor for the development of {COVID}-19 infection, while reduced {ACE} 2 expression during {COVID}-19 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive overview of available scientific knowledge about the role of {ACE} 2 in the pathogenesis of {COVID}-19, which is available up to current day. Also, it discusses unknown factors that we will have to reveal in order to understand the whole role of {ACE} 2 in the pathogenesis of {COVID}-19.}

Patients were classified into four categories: normal glucose, hyperglycaemia (fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and/or {HbA1c} 5.7\%-6.4\%), newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L and/or {HbA1c} ≥6.5\%) and known diabetes. The major outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit ({ICU}) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation ({IMV}). {RESULTS}: Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes constituted the highest percentage to be admitted to the {ICU} (11.7\%) and require {IMV} (11.7\%), followed by patients with known diabetes (4.1\%; 9.2\%) and patients with hyperglycaemia (6.2\%; 4.7\%), compared with patients with normal glucose (1.5\%; 2.3\%), respectively. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of mortality among {COVID}-19 patients with normal glucose, hyperglycaemia, newly diagnosed diabetes and known diabetes were 1.00, 3.29 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.65-16.6), 9.42 (95\% {CI} 2.18-40.7) and 4.63 (95\% {CI} 1.02-21.0), respectively. {CONCLUSION}: We showed that {COVID}-19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest risk of all-cause mortality compared with {COVID}-19 patients with known diabetes, hyperglycaemia and normal glucose.

Venous thrombotic events, particularly pulmonary embolism, with elevated D-dimer and coagulation activation are highly prevalent in {COVID}-19 patients. The pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, with elevated levels of interleukin-6 ({IL}-6), {IL}-2 receptor, and tumor necrosis factor-\alpha, could also participate in endothelial dysfunction and leukocyte recruitment in the microvasculature. {COVID}-19-induced endotheliitis may explain the systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different organs in {COVID}-19 patients. Ongoing trials directly and indirectly target {COVID}-19-related endothelial dysfunctions: i.e., a virus-cell entry using recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) and transmembrane protease serine 2 ({TMPR\SS}-2) blockade, coagulation activation, and immunomodulatory therapies, such as anti-{IL}-6 strategies. Studies focusing on endothelial dysfunction in {COVID}-19 patients are warranted as to decipher their precise role in severe {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and organ dysfunction and to identify targets for further interventions.}

Vaccine development focuses on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated, encoding around 66-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Here, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on {MERS} S that results in the formation of oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which were absent on {SARS} and {HKU1} {CoVs}. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including {HIV}-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Overall, our data reveal how organisation of glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the protein surface.}

abstract = {Respiratory virus infection is one of the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. These exacerbations are associated with high morbidity and even mortality worldwide. The current understanding on viral-induced exacerbations is that viral infection increases airway inflammation which aggravates disease symptoms. Recent advances in in vitro air-liquid interface {3D} cultures, organoid cultures and the use of novel human and animal challenge models have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations. In this review, we will focus on recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including {miRNA} modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways. First, we reviewed the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Subsequently we also summarized how recent models have expanded our appreciation of the mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbations. Further we highlighted the importance of the virome within the airway microbiome environment and its impact on subsequent bacterial infection. This review consolidates the understanding of viral induced exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases and indicates pathways that may be targeted for more effective management of chronic inflammatory diseases.

Worldwide case fatality rate is 11\% (range 7 to 27\%) for the most severely affected regions. Several adverse prognostic factors have been identified, including advanced age, presence of comorbidity, higher lactose dehydrogenase levels and initial neutrophil count, but the impact of viral and other host factors on outcome is unknown. Published data on sequelae of {SARS} are limited. Clinical follow-up of patients who recovered from {SARS} has demonstrated radiological, functional and psychological abnormalities of varying degrees. In the early rehabilitation phase, many complained of limitations in physical function from general weakness and/or shortness of breath. In a small series of subjects who underwent {CT} scan of the chest, over half showed some patchy changes consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Lung function testing at 6-8 weeks after hospital discharge showed mild or moderate restrictive pattern consistent with muscle weakness in 6-20\% of subjects. Mild decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was detected in a minority of subjects. Preliminary evidence suggests that these lung function abnormalities will improve over time. Psychobehavioural problems of anxiety and/or depression were not uncommon in the early recovery phase, and improved over time in the majority of patients. Avascular necrosis of the hip has been reported as another complication. The long-term sequelae of {SARS} are still largely unknown. It is important to follow up these patients to detect and appropriately manage any persistent or emerging long-term sequelae in the physical, psychological and social domains.}

In this study, we examined the relationship between fasting blood glucose ({FBG}) and 28-day mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) patients not previously diagnosed as having diabetes. {METHODS}: We conducted a retrospective study involving all consecutive {COVID}-19 patients with a definitive 28-day outcome and {FBG} measurement at admission from 24 January 2020 to 10 February 2020 in two hospitals based in Wuhan, China. Demographic and clinical data, 28-day outcomes, in-hospital complications and {CRB}-65 scores of {COVID}-19 patients in the two hospitals were analysed. {CRB}-65 is an effective measure for assessing the severity of pneumonia and is based on four indicators, i.e. confusion, respiratory rate (\textgreater30/min), systolic blood pressure (≤90 {mmHg}) or diastolic blood pressure (≤60 {mmHg}), and age (≥65 years). {RESULTS}: Six hundred and five {COVID}-19 patients were enrolled, including 114 who died in hospital. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age ({HR} 1.02 [95\% {CI} 1.00, 1.04]), male sex ({HR} 1.75 [95\% {CI} 1.17, 2.60]), {CRB}-65 score 1-2 ({HR} 2.68 [95\% {CI} 1.56, 4.59]), {CRB}-65 score 3-4 ({HR} 5.25 [95\% {CI} 2.05, 13.43]) and {FBG} ≥7.0 mmol/l ({HR} 2.30 [95\% {CI} 1.49, 3.55]) were independent predictors for 28-day mortality. The {OR} for 28-day in-hospital complications in those with {FBG} ≥7.0 mmol/l and 6.1-6.9 mmol/l vs \textless 6.1 mmol/l was 3.99 (95\% {CI} 2.71, 5.88) or 2.61 (95\% {CI} 1.64, 4.41), respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}/{INTERPRETATION}: {FBG} ≥7.0 mmol/l at admission is an independent predictor for 28-day mortality in patients with {COVID}-19 without previous diagnosis of diabetes. Glycaemic testing and control are important to all {COVID}-19 patients even where they have no pre-existing diabetes, as most {COVID}-19 patients are prone to glucose metabolic disorders.

abstract = {The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) and the ensuing global pandemic has presented a health emergency of unprecedented magnitude. Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke. Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe {COVID}-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality. The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe {COVID}-19 are due to the ability of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to invade endothelial cells via {ACE}-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface. However, in patients with {COVID}-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in {COVID}-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in {COVID}-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance. Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent {COVID}-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, {FXII} inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects. The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of {COVID}-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications. The shifting paradigm of diagnostic and treatment strategies holds significant promise to reduce the burden of thrombotic complications and ultimately improve the prognosis for patients with {COVID}-19.}

abstract = {The spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has been undergoing mutations and is highly glycosylated. It is critically important to investigate the biological significance of these mutations. Here, we investigated 80 variants and 26 glycosylation site modifications for the infectivity and reactivity to a panel of neutralizing antibodies and sera from convalescent patients. {D614G}, along with several variants containing both {D614G} and another amino acid change, were significantly more infectious. Most variants with amino acid change at receptor binding domain were less infectious, but variants including {A475V}, {L452R}, {V483A}, and {F490L} became resistant to some neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the majority of glycosylation deletions were less infectious, whereas deletion of both N331 and N343 glycosylation drastically reduced infectivity, revealing the importance of glycosylation for viral infectivity. Interestingly, {N234Q} was markedly resistant to neutralizing antibodies, whereas {N165Q} became more sensitive. These findings could be of value in the development of vaccine and therapeutic antibodies. Copyright \copyright 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

The prevalence of bacterial infection in patients infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is not well understood. {AIMS}: To determine the prevalence of bacterial co-infection (at presentation) and secondary infection (after presentation) in patients with {COVID}-19. {SOURCES}: We performed a systematic search of {MEDLINE}, {OVID} Epub and {EMBASE} databases for English language literature from 2019 to April 16, 2020. Studies were included if they (a) evaluated patients with confirmed {COVID}-19 and (b) reported the prevalence of acute bacterial infection. {CONTENT}: Data were extracted by a single reviewer and cross-checked by a second reviewer. The main outcome was the proportion of {COVID}-19 patients with an acute bacterial infection. Any bacteria detected from non-respiratory-tract or non-bloodstream sources were excluded. Of 1308 studies screened, 24 were eligible and included in the rapid review representing 3338 patients with {COVID}-19 evaluated for acute bacterial infection. In the meta-analysis, bacterial co-infection (estimated on presentation) was identified in 3.5\% of patients (95\%{CI} 0.4-6.7\%) and secondary bacterial infection in 14.3\% of patients (95\%{CI} 9.6-18.9\%). The overall proportion of {COVID}-19 patients with bacterial infection was 6.9\% (95\%{CI} 4.3-9.5\%). Bacterial infection was more common in critically ill patients (8.1\%, 95\%{CI} 2.3-13.8\%). The majority of patients with {COVID}-19 received antibiotics (71.9\%, 95\%{CI} 56.1 to 87.7\%). {IMPLICATIONS}: Bacterial co-infection is relatively infrequent in hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19. The majority of these patients may not require empirical antibacterial treatment. Crown Copyright \copyright 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

For understanding the susceptibility for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, the cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary. The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}). Here, we report the expression pattern of {ACE2} across \textgreater 150 different cell types corresponding to all major human tissues and organs based on stringent immunohistochemical analysis. The results were compared with several datasets both on the {mRNA} and protein level. {ACE2} expression was mainly observed in enterocytes, renal tubules, gallbladder, cardiomyocytes, male reproductive cells, placental trophoblasts, ductal cells, eye, and vasculature. In the respiratory system, the expression was limited, with no or only low expression in a subset of cells in a few individuals, observed by one antibody only. Our data constitute an important resource for further studies on {SARS}-{CoV}-2 host cell entry, in order to understand the biology of the disease and to aid in the development of effective treatments to the viral infection. \copyright 2020 The Authors.

The effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) vaccines on viral replication in both upper and lower airways is important to evaluate in nonhuman primates. {METHODS}: Nonhuman primates received 10 or 100 μg of {mRNA}-1273, a vaccine encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, or no vaccine. Antibody and T-cell responses were assessed before upper- and lower-airway challenge with {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Active viral replication and viral genomes in bronchoalveolar-lavage ({BAL}) fluid and nasal swab specimens were assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and histopathological analysis and viral quantification were performed on lung-tissue specimens. {RESULTS}: The {mRNA}-1273 vaccine candidate induced antibody levels exceeding those in human convalescent-phase serum, with live-virus reciprocal 50\% inhibitory dilution ({ID50}) geometric mean titers of 501 in the 10-μg dose group and 3481 in the 100-μg dose group. Vaccination induced type 1 helper T-cell (Th1)-biased {CD4} T-cell responses and low or undetectable Th2 or {CD8} T-cell responses. Viral replication was not detectable in {BAL} fluid by day 2 after challenge in seven of eight animals in both vaccinated groups. No viral replication was detectable in the nose of any of the eight animals in the 100-μg dose group by day 2 after challenge, and limited inflammation or detectable viral genome or antigen was noted in lungs of animals in either vaccine group. {CONCLUSIONS}: Vaccination of nonhuman primates with {mRNA}-1273 induced robust {SARS}-{CoV}-2 neutralizing activity, rapid protection in the upper and lower airways, and no pathologic changes in the lung.

Furthermore, {AGEs} can interact with specific cell surface receptors and hence alter cell intracellular signaling, gene expression, the production of reactive oxygen species and the activation of several inflammatory pathways. High levels of {AGEs} in diet as well as in tissues and the circulation are pathogenic to a wide range of diseases. With respect to mobility, {AGEs} accumulate in bones, joints and skeletal muscles, playing important roles in the development of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and sarcopenia with aging. This report covered the related pathological mechanisms and the potential pharmaceutical and dietary intervention strategies in reducing systemic {AGEs}. More prospective studies are needed to determine whether elevated serum {AGEs} and/or skin autofluorescence predict a decline in measures of mobility. In addition, human intervention studies are required to investigate the beneficial effects of exogenous {AGEs} inhibitors on mobility outcomes.}

Using the {LHS}-integrated electronic medical records system, we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socio-economic status, weight, height, body mass index, {HbA1c}, prior diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, smoking, and chronic lung disease. {RESULTS}: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85\%) were diagnosed with {COVID}-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socio-economic background and had a higher baseline {HbA1c}. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was {HbA1c} ≥ 9\%. {CONCLUSION}: Using pre-infection glycaemic control data, we identify {HbA1c} as a clear predictor of {COVID}-19 severity. Pre-infection risk stratification is crucial to successfully manage this disease, efficiently allocate resources, and minimize the economic and social burden associated with an undiscriminating approach. \copyright 2020 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.}

abstract = {Importance: Effective therapies for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) are needed, and clinical trial data have demonstrated that low-dose dexamethasone reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19 who required respiratory support. Objective: To estimate the association between administration of corticosteroids compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective meta-analysis that pooled data from 7 randomized clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of corticosteroids in 1703 critically ill patients with {COVID}-19. The trials were conducted in 12 countries from February 26, 2020, to June 9, 2020, and the date of final follow-up was July 6, 2020. Pooled data were aggregated from the individual trials, overall, and in predefined subgroups. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis of overall mortality, with the association between the intervention and mortality quantified using odds ratios ({ORs}). Random-effects meta-analyses also were conducted (with the Paule-Mandel estimate of heterogeneity and the Hartung-Knapp adjustment) and an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect analysis using risk ratios. Exposures: Patients had been randomized to receive systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone (678 patients) or to receive usual care or placebo (1025 patients). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. A secondary outcome was investigator-defined serious adverse events. Results: A total of 1703 patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 52-68 years]; 488 [29\%] women) were included in the analysis. Risk of bias was assessed as "low" for 6 of the 7 mortality results and as "some concerns" in 1 trial because of the randomization method. Five trials reported mortality at 28 days, 1 trial at 21 days, and 1 trial at 30 days. There were 222 deaths among the 678 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 425 deaths among the 1025 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary {OR}, 0.66 [95\% {CI}, 0.53-0.82]; P \textless  .001 based on a fixed-effect meta-analysis). There was little inconsistency between the trial results (I2 = 15.6\%; P = .31 for heterogeneity) and the summary {OR} was 0.70 (95\% {CI}, 0.48-1.01; P = .053) based on the random-effects meta-analysis. The fixed-effect summary {OR} for the association with mortality was 0.64 (95\% {CI}, 0.50-0.82; P \textless  .001) for dexamethasone compared with usual care or placebo (3 trials, 1282 patients, and 527 deaths), the {OR} was 0.69 (95\% {CI}, 0.43-1.12; P = .13) for hydrocortisone (3 trials, 374 patients, and 94 deaths), and the {OR} was 0.91 (95\% {CI}, 0.29-2.87; P = .87) for methylprednisolone (1 trial, 47 patients, and 26 deaths). Among the 6 trials that reported serious adverse events, 64 events occurred among 354 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 80 events occurred among 342 patients randomized to usual care or placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill patients with {COVID}-19, administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.}

Here, the effects of high glucose levels on influenza severity were investigated using an in vitro model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier as well as an in vivo murine model of type {II} diabetes. In vitro we show that high glucose conditions prior to {IAV} infection increased virus-induced barrier damage. This was associated with an increased pro-inflammatory response in endothelial cells and the subsequent damage of the epithelial junctional complex. These results were subsequently validated in vivo. This study provides the first evidence that hyperglycaemia may increase influenza severity by damaging the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier and increasing pulmonary oedema. These data suggest that maintaining long-term glucose control in individuals with diabetes is paramount in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus infections. \copyright 2020, Hulme et al.}

abstract = {The current emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) demands the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent rapid progress of mortalities. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high-resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor-binding domain of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O-glycosylation are strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research toward the development of a suitable vaccine candidate. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 is an enveloped virus responsible for the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins, the detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus using cryoelectron tomography (cryo-{ET}) and subtomogram averaging ({STA}). Native structures of the S proteins in pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 8.7-11 {\AA}. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which revealed overall processing states of the native glycans highly similar to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The native conformation of the ribonucleoproteins ({RNPs}) and their higher-order assemblies were revealed. Overall, these characterizations revealed the architecture of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus in exceptional detail and shed light on how the virus packs its ∼30-kb-long single-segmented {RNA} in the ∼80-nm-diameter lumen.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {COVID}-19 is known as a new viral infection. Viral-bacterial co-infections are one of the biggest medical concerns, resulting in increased mortality rates. To date, few studies have investigated bacterial superinfections in {COVID}-19 patients. Hence, we designed the current study on {COVID}-19 patients admitted to {ICUs}. {METHODS}: Nineteen patients admitted to our {ICUs} were enrolled in this study. To detect {COVID}-19, reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed. Endotracheal aspirate samples were also collected and cultured on different media to support the growth of the bacteria. After incubation, formed colonies on the media were identified using Gram staining and other biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out based on the {CLSI} recommendations. {RESULTS}: Of nineteen {COVID}-19 patients, 11 (58\%) patients were male and 8 (42\%) were female, with a mean age of \~ 67 years old. The average {ICU} length of stay was \~ 15 days and at the end of the study, 18 cases (95\%) expired and only was 1 case (5\%) discharged. In total, all patients were found positive for bacterial infections, including seventeen Acinetobacter baumannii (90\%) and two Staphylococcus aureus (10\%) strains. There was no difference in the bacteria species detected in any of the sampling points. Seventeen of 17 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to the evaluated antibiotics. No metallo-beta-lactamases -producing Acinetobacter baumannii strain was found. One of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates was detected as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and isolated from the patient who died, while another Staphylococcus aureus strain was susceptible to tested drugs and identified as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings emphasize the concern of superinfection in {COVID}-19 patients due to Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus. Consequently, it is important to pay attention to bacterial co-infections in critical patients positive for {COVID}-19.}

Development was initiated when the genetic sequence of the virus became available in early January 2020, and has moved at an unprecedented speed: a phase I trial started in March 2020 and there are currently more than 180 vaccines at various stages of development. Data from phase I and phase {II} trials are already available for several vaccine candidates, and many have moved into phase {III} trials. The data available so far suggest that effective and safe vaccines might become available within months, rather than years.}

abstract = {The ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has resulted in more than 28,000,000 infections and 900,000 deaths worldwide to date. Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}). Similar to many other viral fusion proteins, the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of the glycosylated {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the roles of glycans and on the protein structure and dynamics. We reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike's receptor binding domain ({RBD}), which is responsible for {ACE2} recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these glycans through {N165A} and {N234A} mutations significantly reduces binding to {ACE2} as a result of the {RBD} conformational shift toward the "down" state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein, which may be exploited in the therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional and structural insights into the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein and its glycan coat, providing a strategy to control the conformational plasticity of the {RBD} that could be harnessed for vaccine development.}

abstract = {No major advances have been made in improving overall survival for glioblastoma ({GBM}) in almost 100 years. The current standard of care ({SOC}) for {GBM} involves immediate surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy. Corticosteroid (dexamethasone) is often prescribed to {GBM} patients to reduce tumor edema and inflammation. The {SOC} disrupts the glutamate-glutamine cycle thus increasing availability of glucose and glutamine in the tumor microenvironment. Glucose and glutamine are the prime fermentable fuels that underlie therapy resistance and drive {GBM} growth through substrate level phosphorylation in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, respectively. Emerging evidence indicates that ketogenic metabolic therapy ({KMT}) can reduce glucose availability while elevating ketone bodies that are neuroprotective and non-fermentable. Information is presented from preclinical and case report studies showing how {KMT} could target tumor cells without causing neurochemical damage thus improving progression free and overall survival for patients with {GBM}.}

English full text observational studies describing the laboratory findings and outcomes of {COVID}-19 hospitalised patients were identified searching {PubMed}, Web of Science, Scopus, {medRxiv} using Medical Subject Headings ({MeSH}) terms {COVID}-19 {OR} coronavirus {OR} {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {OR} 2019-{nCoV} from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 following Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ({MOOSE}) guidelines. {PARTICIPANTS}: Studies having biomarkers, including lymphocyte, platelets, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase ({LDH}), C reactive protein ({CRP}), aspartate aminotransferase ({AST}), alanine aminotransferase ({ALT}), creatinine, procalcitonin ({PCT}) and creatine kinase ({CK}), and describing outcomes were selected with the consensus of three independent reviewers. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Composite poor outcomes include intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation \textless 90\%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilisation, severe disease, in-hospital admission and mortality. The {OR} and 95\% {CI} were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models.

Here we aimed to examine the associations between {IFG} and diabetes at admission with risks of complications and mortality among patients with {COVID}-19. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 312 hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19 from 5 hospitals in Wuhan from Jan 1 to Mar 17, 2020. Clinical information, laboratory findings, complications, treatment regimens, and mortality status were collected. The associations between hyperglycemia and diabetes status at admission with primary composite end-point events (including mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death) were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: The median age of the patients was 57 years (interquartile range 38-66), and 172 (55\%) were women. At the time of hospital admission, 84 (27\%) had diabetes (and 36 were new-diagnosed), 62 (20\%) had {IFG}, and 166 (53\%) had normal fasting glucose ({NFG}) levels. Compared to patients with {NFG}, patients with {IFG} and diabetes developed more primary composite end-point events (9 [5\%], 11 [18\%], 26 [31\%]), including receiving mechanical ventilation (5 [3\%], 6 [10\%], 21 [25\%]), and death (4 [2\%], 9 [15\%], 20 [24\%]). Multivariable Cox regression analyses showed diabetes was associated increased risks of primary composite end-point events (hazard ratio 3.53; 95\% confidence interval 1.48-8.40) and mortality (6.25; 1.91-20.45), and {IFG} was associated with an increased risk of mortality (4.11; 1.15-14.74), after adjusting for age, sex, hospitals and comorbidities. Conclusion: {IFG} and diabetes at admission were associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes among patients with {COVID}-19.

abstract = {Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) infection has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long {COVID} (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed. Methods: An ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires ({EQ}-{5D}-{5L}, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions. Findings: Between April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 ({SD} 11.0) years, 70\% female, 87\% white, 31\% healthcare workers) completed assessments following {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection (median 140, {IQR} 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20\%, hypertension: 6\%; diabetes: 2\%; heart disease: 4\%) was low, and only 18\% of individuals had been hospitalised with {COVID}-19. Fatigue (98\%), muscle aches (88\%), breathlessness (87\%), and headaches (83\%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92\%) and gastrointestinal (73\%) symptoms were common, and 42\% of individuals had ten or more symptoms. There was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32\%), lungs (33\%), kidneys (12\%), liver (10\%), pancreas (17\%), and spleen (6\%). Single (66\%) and multi-organ (25\%) impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior {COVID}-19 hospitalisation (p\textless0.05). Interpretation: In a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70\% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long {COVID} but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.}

In addition, {SP}-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that {SP}-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of {SP}-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of {SP}-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized {SP}-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.}

Surfactant protein D ({SP}-D), a lung collectin, markedly accumulates during P. carinii pneumonia and binds to glycoprotein A ({gpA}) on the surface of P. carinii, thereby enhancing interactions with alveolar macrophages. Herein, we report the structural basis of the interaction of {SP}-D with {gpA}. We demonstrate that natural {SP}-D binds to purified {gpA} in the presence of 2 {mM} calcium in a saturable, concentration-dependent manner, which is abolished by 10 {mM} ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Increasing concentrations of calcium under otherwise cation-free conditions significantly enhance {SP}-D binding to {gpA}, whereas manganese and magnesium cations have minimal effect. Maximal {SP}-D binding occurs at {pH} 7.4, with significant inhibition at {pH} 4. {SP}-D binding to {gpA} is also competitively inhibited by {maltose\textgreaterglucose\textgreatermannose\textgreaterN}-acetyl-glucosamine. Comparison of the binding of various natural and recombinant forms of {SP}-D to {gpA} reveals that the number of carbohydrate recognition domains ({CRDs}) in a given {SP}-D form determines the relative extent of binding to {gpA}. Maximal binding is observed with natural {SP}-D (dodecamers and higher order {SP}-D complexes) followed by recombinant dodecamers. In contrast, recombinant full-length trimers exhibit substantially less binding, which is similar to that observed with a recombinant truncated molecule consisting of the {CRD} and neck regions, and containing trimers of this portion of the molecule. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that the {CRD} of {SP}-D mediates interaction with P. carinii {gpA} through its attached oligosaccharides and that the extent of {SP}-D binding to P. carinii is greatest with dodecamers and higher order forms of {SP}-D.}

The extent of viral replication in the lungs was proportional to blood glucose levels in the mice at the time of infection, and the enhanced susceptibility of diabetic mice was reversed with insulin. Growth of A/{HKx31} ({H3N2}) virus was also enhanced in diabetic mice, whereas the highly virulent strain A/{PR}/8/34 ({H1N1}) showed no difference in virus yields in diabetic and nondiabetic mice, even with low inocula. A/Phil/82 and A/{HKx31} are sensitive to neutralization in vitro by the pulmonary collectin surfactant protein D ({SP}-D), whereas A/{PR}/8/34 is essentially resistant. Glucose is a ligand for {SP}-D, and neutralization of A/Phil/82 virus by {SP}-D was abolished in the presence of glucose at levels commonly found in diabetic mice. These findings suggest that in mice, and perhaps in humans, diabetes predisposes to influenza virus infection through compromise of collectin-mediated host defense of the lung by glucose.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIMS}: Presence of comorbidities in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) have often been associated with increased in-hospital complications and mortality. Intriguingly, several developed countries with a higher quality of life have relatively higher mortality with {COVID}-19, compared to the middle- or low-income countries. Moreover, certain ethnic groups have shown a higher predilection to contract {COVID}-19, with heightened mortality. We sought to review the available literature with regards to impact of {COVID}-19 and comorbidities on the health and economics, especially in context to the developing countries including India. {METHODS}: A Boolean search was carried out in {PubMed}, {MedRxiv} and Google Scholar databases up till August 23, 2020 using the specific keywords, to find the prevalence of comorbidities and its outcome in patients with {COVID}-19. {RESULTS}: All available evidence consistently suggests that presence of comorbidities is associated with a poor outcome in patients with {COVID}-19. Diabetes prevalence is highest in Indian {COVID}-19 patients, compared to other countries. Majority of the patients with {COVID}-19 are asymptomatic ranging from 26 to 76\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: Universal masking is the need of hour during unlock period. Low-income countries such as India, Brazil and Africa with less resources and an average socio-economic background, must adopt a strict policy for an affordable testing programs to trace, test, identify and home quarantine of asymptomatic cases. Despite the huge number of {COVID}-19 patients, India still has low volume research at the moment. Copyright \copyright 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Infection is associated with development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity that can protect against infection in animal models. Antibody levels decrease with time, but the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be called upon to produce antibodies upon re-infection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection. We find that {IgM}, and {IgG} anti-{SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike protein receptor binding domain ({RBD}) antibody titers decrease significantly with {IgA} being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by five-fold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of {RBD}-specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to {RBD} mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Analysis of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals 4 months after coronavirus disease-2019 ({COVID}-19) onset, using immunofluorescence, or polymerase chain reaction, revealed persistence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 volunteers. We conclude that the memory B cell response to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 evolves between 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection in a manner that is consistent with antigen persistence.}

A common denominator, hyperinsulinaemia, provides a plausible mechanism of action, underlying {CVD}, hypertension and strokes, all conditions typified with thrombi. The underlying science provides a theoretical management algorithm for the frontline practitioners.Vitamin D activation requires magnesium. Hyperinsulinaemia promotes: magnesium depletion via increased renal excretion, reduced intracellular levels, lowers vitamin D status via sequestration into adipocytes and hydroxylation activation inhibition. Hyperinsulinaemia mediates thrombi development via: fibrinolysis inhibition, anticoagulation production dysregulation, increasing reactive oxygen species, decreased antioxidant capacity via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion, haem oxidation and catabolism, producing carbon monoxide, increasing deep vein thrombosis risk and pulmonary emboli. Increased haem-synthesis demand upregulates carbon dioxide production, decreasing oxygen saturation capacity. Hyperinsulinaemia decreases cholesterol sulfurylation to cholesterol sulfate, as low vitamin D regulation due to magnesium depletion and/or vitamin D sequestration and/or diminished activation capacity decreases sulfotransferase enzyme {SULT2B1b} activity, consequently decreasing plasma membrane negative charge between red blood cells, platelets and endothelial cells, thus increasing agglutination and thrombosis.Patients with {COVID}-19 admitted with hyperglycaemia and/or hyperinsulinaemia should be placed on a restricted refined carbohydrate diet, with limited use of intravenous dextrose solutions. Degree/level of restriction is determined by serial testing of blood glucose, insulin and ketones. Supplemental magnesium, vitamin D and zinc should be administered. By implementing refined carbohydrate restriction, three primary risk factors, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and hypertension, that increase inflammation, coagulation and thrombosis risk are rapidly managed. \copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Patients were categorized into three groups according to admission {BG} levels: \textless 140 mg/{dL}, 140-180 mg/{dL} and \textgreater180 mg/{dL}.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: With the unprecedented morbidity and mortality associated with the {COVID}-19 pandemic, a vaccine against {COVID}-19 is urgently needed. We investigated {CoronaVac} (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China), an inactivated vaccine candidate against {COVID}-19, containing inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), for its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. {METHODS}: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial, healthy adults aged 18-59 years were recruited from the community in Suining County of Jiangsu province, China. Adults with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 exposure or infection history, with axillary temperature above 37·0°C, or an allergic reaction to any vaccine component were excluded. The experimental vaccine for the phase 1 trial was manufactured using a cell factory process ({CellSTACK} Cell Culture Chamber 10, Corning, Wujiang, China), whereas those for the phase 2 trial were produced through a bioreactor process ({ReadyToProcess} {WAVE} 25, {GE}, Umea, Sweden). The phase 1 trial was done in a dose-escalating manner. At screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into two vaccination schedule cohorts, the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and within each cohort the first 36 participants were assigned to block 1 (low dose {CoronaVac} [3 μg per 0·5 {mL} of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dose) then another 36 were assigned to block 2 (high-dose Coronavc [6 μg per 0·5 {mL} of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dse]). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of six, to either two doses of {CoronaVac} or two doses of placebo. In the phase 2 trial, at screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of five, to receive two doses of either low-dose {CoronaVac}, high-dose {CoronaVac}, or placebo. Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after injection in all participants who were given at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The primary immunogenic outcome was seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies to live {SARS}-{CoV}-2 at day 14 after the last dose in the days 0 and 14 cohort, and at day 28 after the last dose in the days 0 and 28 cohort in participants who completed their allocated two-dose vaccination schedule (per-protocol population). This trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT04352608}, and is closed to accrual. {FINDINGS}: Between April 16 and April 25, 2020, 144 participants were enrolled in the phase 1 trial, and between May 3 and May 5, 2020, 600 participants were enrolled in the phase 2 trial. 743 participants received at least one dose of investigational product (n=143 for phase 1 and n=600 for phase 2; safety population). In the phase 1 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was seven (29\%) of 24 participants in the 3 ug group, nine (38\%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and two (8\%) of 24 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was three (13\%) of 24 in the 3 μg group, four (17\%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and three (13\%) of 23 in the placebo group. The seroconversion of neutralising antibodies on day 14 after the days 0 and 14 vaccination schedule was seen in 11 (46\%) of 24 participants in the 3 μg group, 12 (50\%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and none (0\%) of 24 in the placebo group; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 vaccination schedule, seroconversion was seen in 20 (83\%) of 24 in the 3 μg group, 19 (79\%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and one (4\%) of 24 in the placebo group. In the phase 2 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was 40 (33\%) of 120 participants in the 3 μg group, 42 (35\%) of 120 in the 6 μg group, and 13 (22\%) of 60 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was 23 (19\%) of 120 in the 3 μg group, 23 (19\%) of 120 in the 6 μg group, and 11 (18\%) of 60 for the placebo group. Seroconversion of neutralising antibodies was seen for 109 (92\%) of 118 participants in the 3 μg group, 117 (98\%) of 119 in the 6 μg group, and two (3\%) of 60 in the placebo group at day 14 after the days 0 and 14 schedule; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 schedule, seroconversion was seen in 114 (97\%) of 117 in the 3 μg group, 118 (100\%) of 118 in the 6 μg group, and none (0\%) of 59 in the placebo group. {INTERPRETATION}: Taking safety, immunogenicity, and production capacity into account, the 3 μg dose of {CoronaVac} is the suggested dose for efficacy assessment in future phase 3 trials. {FUNDING}: Chinese National Key Research and Development Program and Beijing Science and Technology Program.

The clinical spectrum of {COVID}-19 is wide, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe pneumonia, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes resulting in poor outcomes. Among the various consequences of severe {COVID}-19, cardiovascular ({CV}) collapse appears the most serious and potentially lethal. On the other hand, pre-existent {CV} comorbidities are also associated with higher mortality. The most reliable hypothetical pathogenetic mechanism for {CV} complications and cardiac injury in severe {COVID}-19 patients appears to be a sustained endothelial dysfunction, caused by the interplay of inflammation and coagulation. In this review, we survey papers addressing issues related to severe {COVID}-19, characterized by enhanced lung microvascular loss, hypercytokinemia, hypoxemia and thrombosis. We discuss about how the virus-induced downregulation of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ({ACE2}) receptor, used to enter the host cell, could affect the renin-angiotensin system, attempting to clarify the doubts about the use of {ACE} inhibitors and Angiotensin-{II} receptor blockers in {COVID}-19 patients. Finally, we point out how the delicate and physiological homeostatic function of the endothelium, which turns into a disastrous battlefield of the complex interaction between "cytokine and coagulative storms", can be irreparably compromised and result in systemic inflammatory complications.

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus ({T2DM}) is associated with both poorer clinical outcomes during the {COVID}-19 pandemic and an increased risk of death in such hospitalized patients. While the role of glucose control has been emphasized to improve the prognosis, the impact of different glucose-lowering agents remains largely unknown. Metformin remains the first-line pharmacological choice for the management of hyperglycaemia in {T2DM}. Because metformin exerts various effects beyond its glucose-lowering action, among which are anti-inflammatory effects, it may be speculated that this biguanide might positively influence the prognosis of patients with {T2DM} hospitalized for {COVID}-19. The present concise review summarizes the available data from observational retrospective studies that have shown a reduction in mortality in metformin users compared with non-users, and briefly discusses the potential underlying mechanisms that might perhaps explain this favourable impact. However, given the potential confounders inherently found in observational studies, caution is required before drawing any firm conclusions in the absence of randomized controlled trials.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A safe and efficacious vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), if deployed with high coverage, could contribute to the control of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the {ChAdOx1} {nCoV}-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials. {METHODS}: This analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the {UK}, Brazil, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to {ChAdOx1} {nCoV}-19 vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline). Participants in the {ChAdOx1} {nCoV}-19 group received two doses containing 5 × 1010 viral particles (standard dose; {SD}/{SD} cohort); a subset in the {UK} trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose ({LD}/{SD} cohort). The primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic {COVID}-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Studies are registered at {ISRCTN89951424} and {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT04324606}, {NCT04400838}, and {NCT04444674}. {FINDINGS}: Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled and 11 636 participants (7548 in the {UK}, 4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard doses, vaccine efficacy was 62·1\% (95\% {CI} 41·0-75·7; 27 [0·6\%] of 4440 in the {ChAdOx1} {nCoV}-19 group vs71 [1·6\%] of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90·0\% (67·4-97·0; three [0·2\%] of 1367 vs 30 [2·2\%] of 1374; pinteraction=0·010). Overall vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70·4\% (95·8\% {CI} 54·8-80·6; 30 [0·5\%] of 5807 vs 101 [1·7\%] of 5829). From 21 days after the first dose, there were ten cases hospitalised for {COVID}-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe {COVID}-19, including one death. There were 74 341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3·4 months, {IQR} 1·3-4·8): 175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the {ChAdOx1} {nCoV}-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the {ChAdOx1} {nCoV}-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation. {INTERPRETATION}: {ChAdOx1} {nCoV}-19 has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic {COVID}-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials. {FUNDING}: {UK} Research and Innovation, National Institutes for Health Research ({NIHR}), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, Lemann Foundation, Rede D'Or, Brava and Telles Foundation, {NIHR} Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's {NIHR} Clinical Research Network, and {AstraZeneca}.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. {METHODS}: In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the {BNT162b2} vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). {BNT162b2} is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified {RNA} vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored {SARS}-{CoV}-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. {RESULTS}: A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with {BNT162b2} and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive {BNT162b2} and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; {BNT162b2} was 95\% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95\% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100\%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a {BNT162b2} recipient. The safety profile of {BNT162b2} was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. {CONCLUSIONS}: A two-dose regimen of {BNT162b2} conferred 95\% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by {BioNTech} and Pfizer; {ClinicalTrials}.gov number, {NCT04368728}.).

abstract = {The current outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) infection has spread across the world. No specific antiviral agents have been adequately evidenced for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19). Although metformin has been recommended as a host-directed therapy for {COVID}-19, there are some opposite views. The effects of metformin on the disease severity of patients with {COVID}-19 with diabetes during hospitalization remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the effect of metformin on disease severity. We enrolled 110 hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19 with diabetes prescribed either metformin or non-metformin hypoglycemic treatment for a case-control study. The primary outcome was the occurrence of life-threatening complications. There were no differences between the two groups in age, sex, comorbidities, and clinical severity at admission. Blood glucose and lactate dehydrogenase levels of the metformin group were higher than those of the non-metformin group at admission. Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups. Strikingly, the percentage of patients who experienced life-threatening complications was significantly higher in the metformin group (28.6\% (16/56) vs. 7.4\% (4/54), P = 0.004). Antidiabetic therapy with metformin was associated with a higher risk of disease progression in patients with {COVID}-19 with diabetes during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio = 3.964, 95\% confidence interval 1.034-15.194, P = 0.045). This retrospective analysis suggested a potential safety signal for metformin, the use of which was associated with a higher risk of severe {COVID}-19. We propose that metformin withdrawal in patients with {COVID}-19 be considered to prevent disease progression. \copyright 2020 The Authors.

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line medication for {T2D}, but its impact on the outcomes of individuals with {COVID}-19 and {T2D} remains to be clarified. Our current retrospective study in a cohort of 1,213 hospitalized individuals with {COVID}-19 and pre-existing {T2D} indicated that metformin use was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acidosis, particularly in cases with severe {COVID}-19, but not with 28-day {COVID}-19-related mortality.

abstract = {An outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) that started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 has become a global pandemic. Both {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS}-{CoV} enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have reviewed previously published studies on {SARS} and recent studies on {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) by the World Health Organization ({WHO}), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. {ACE2} catalyzes angiotensin {II} conversion to angiotensin-(1-7), and the {ACE2}/angiotensin-(1-7)/{MAS} axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with {COVID}-19 pathogenesis, {ACE2} downregulation and the imbalance between the {RAS} and {ACE2}/angiotensin-(1-7)/{MAS} after infection may also contribute to multiple organ injury in {COVID}-19. The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to {ACE2}, is a potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the {RAS} and {ACE2}/angiotensin-(1-7)/{MAS} may help attenuate organ injuries. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 enters lung cells via the {ACE2} receptor. The cell-free and macrophage-phagocytosed virus can spread to other organs and infect {ACE2}-expressing cells at local sites, causing multi-organ injury.}

Moreover, passively administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-{SARS}-{CoV}-2 agents. However, the degree to which {SARS}-{CoV}-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing antibodies is unclear. Using a recombinant chimeric {VSV}/{SARS}-{CoV}-2 reporter virus, we show that functional {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected. Notably, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating {SARS}-{CoV}-2 populations. Finally, the emergence of antibody-resistant {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants that might limit the therapeutic usefulness of monoclonal antibodies can be mitigated by the use of antibody combinations that target distinct neutralizing epitopes. \copyright 2020, Weisblum et al.}

Persons at high risk for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of {mRNA}-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2. {RESULTS}: The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96\% of participants received both injections, and 2.2\% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the {mRNA}-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95\% {CI}, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1\% (95\% {CI}, 89.3 to 96.8\%; P\textless 0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the {mRNA}-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {mRNA}-1273 vaccine showed 94.1\% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease.

We utilized glycomics-informed glycoproteomics to characterize site-specific microheterogeneity of glycosylation for a recombinant trimer Spike mimetic immunogen and for a soluble version of human {ACE2}. We combined this information with bioinformatics analyses of natural variants and with existing {3D} structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamics simulations of each glycoprotein both alone and interacting with one another. Our results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly modulating Spike-{ACE2} interactions. Furthermore, our results illustrate the impact of viral evolution and divergence on Spike glycosylation, as well as the influence of natural variants on {ACE2} receptor glycosylation.

abstract = {Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) pandemic, has so far resulted in more than 1.1 M deaths and 40 M cases worldwide with no confirmed remedy yet available. Since the first outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, researchers across the globe have been in a race to develop therapies and vaccines against the disease. {SARS}-{CoV}-2, similar to other previously identified Coronaviridae family members, encodes several structural proteins, such as spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, that are responsible for host penetration, binding, recycling, and pathogenesis. Structural biology has been a key player in understanding the viral infection mechanism and in developing intervention strategies against the new coronavirus. The spike glycoprotein has drawn considerable attention as a means to block viral entry owing to its interactions with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), which acts as a receptor. Here, we review the current knowledge of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and its interactions with {ACE2} and antibodies. Structural information of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike glycoprotein and its complexes with {ACE2} and antibodies can provide key input for the development of therapies and vaccines against the new coronavirus.}

We made an inventory of the prevalence and prognostic value of hyperglycaemia, and of the effects of glucose control in different groups of critically ill patients. The prevalence of hyperglycaemia in critically ill patients, using stringent criteria, approaches 100\%. An unambiguous negative correlation between hyperglycaemia and mortality has been described in various groups of critically ill patients. Although the available evidence remains inconsistent, there appears to be a favourable effect of glucose regulation. This effect on morbidity and mortality depends on patient characteristics. To be able to compare results of future studies involving glucose regulation, better definitions of hyperglycaemia (and consequently of normoglycaemia) and patient populations are needed.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A heterologous recombinant adenovirus ({rAd})-based vaccine, Gam-{COVID}-Vac (Sputnik V), showed a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants in phase 1/2 clinical trials. Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-{COVID}-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial. {METHODS}: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {PCR} and {IgG} and {IgM} tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (0·5 {mL}/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose ({rAd26}) and the second dose ({rAd5}), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length {SARS}-{CoV}-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with {PCR}-confirmed {COVID}-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at {ClinicalTrials}.gov ({NCT04530396}). {FINDINGS}: Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21 977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16 501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0·1\%) of 14 964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1·3\%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have {COVID}-19; vaccine efficacy was 91·6\% (95\% {CI} 85·6-95·2). Most reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [94·0\%] of 7966 total events). 45 (0·3\%) of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (0·4\%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee. Four deaths were reported during the study (three [\textless 0·1\%] of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and one [\textless 0·1\%] of 5435 participants in the placebo group), none of which were considered related to the vaccine. {INTERPRETATION}: This interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-{COVID}-Vac showed 91·6\% efficacy against {COVID}-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort. {FUNDING}: Moscow City Health Department, Russian Direct Investment Fund, and Sberbank.

Using a model that incorporates daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low, ranging from 13 to 18\%, and that the reproductive number may be larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together with presymptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at similar rates as symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1. Even in this regime, presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50\% of the force of infection at the outbreak peak. We find no regimes in which all infection subpopulations have reproductive numbers lower than three. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second epidemic waves. Complementary information is required to determine the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases, which we discuss. Regardless, current assumptions about the basic reproductive number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-Cov-2) should be reconsidered. Copyright \copyright 2021 the Author(s).

The patients were screened after hospital admission from 10 March to 10 April 2020. We mainly focused on hospital discharge and death within 28 days. {RESULTS}: We included 2796 participants: 63.7\% men, mean age 69.7 ± 13.2 years, median {BMI} (25th-75th percentile) 28.4 (25.0-32.4) kg/m2. Microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were found in 44.2\% and 38.6\% of participants, respectively. Within 28 days, 1404 (50.2\%; 95\% {CI} 48.3\%, 52.1\%) were discharged from hospital with a median duration of hospital stay of 9 (5-14) days, while 577 participants died (20.6\%; 95\% {CI} 19.2\%, 22.2\%). In multivariable models, younger age, routine metformin therapy and longer symptom duration on admission were positively associated with discharge. History of microvascular complications, anticoagulant routine therapy, dyspnoea on admission, and higher aspartate aminotransferase, white cell count and C-reactive protein levels were associated with a reduced chance of discharge. Factors associated with death within 28 days mirrored those associated with discharge, and also included routine treatment by insulin and statin as deleterious factors. {CONCLUSIONS}/{INTERPRETATION}: In patients with diabetes hospitalised for {COVID}-19, we established prognostic factors for hospital discharge and death that could help clinicians in this pandemic period. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: {NCT04324736}.}

Fusion of coronaviruses is generally thought to occur at neutral {pH}, although there is also evidence for a role of acidic endosomes during entry of a variety of coronaviruses. Therefore, the molecular basis of coronavirus fusion during entry into host cells remains incompletely defined. Here, we examined coronavirus-cell fusion and entry employing the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ({IBV}). Virus entry into cells was inhibited by acidotropic bases and by other inhibitors of {pH}-dependent endocytosis. We carried out fluorescence-dequenching fusion assays of R18-labeled virions and show that for {IBV}, coronavirus-cell fusion occurs in a low-{pH}-dependent manner, with a half-maximal rate of fusion occurring at {pH} 5.5. Fusion was reduced, but still occurred, at lower temperatures (20 degrees C). We observed no effect of inhibitors of endosomal proteases on the fusion event. These data are the first direct measure of virus-cell fusion for any coronavirus and demonstrate that the coronavirus {IBV} employs a direct, low-{pH}-dependent virus-cell fusion activation reaction. We further show that {IBV} was not inactivated, and fusion was unaffected, by prior exposure to {pH} 5.0 buffer. Virions also showed evidence of reversible conformational changes in their surface proteins, indicating that aspects of the fusion reaction may be reversible in nature.}

It is common to observe diffuse microvascular thrombi in multiple organs, mostly in pulmonary microvessels.

Staphylococcus aureus growth increased at \textgreater or =0.5 mmol L(-1) (p=0.006) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth above 1-4 mmol L(-1) glucose (p=0.039). {CONCLUSIONS}: {BG\textgreater} or =8 mmol L(-1) predicted elevated {AG} concentrations in {CF}, at least in nasal secretions. {CFRD} patients spent approximately 50\% day with {BG\textgreaterairway} threshold, implying persistently elevated {AG} concentrations. Further studies are required to determine whether elevated airway glucose concentrations contribute to accelerated pulmonary decline in {CFRD}.}

abstract = {Proper development and function of the mammalian brain is critically dependent on a steady supply of its chief energy source, glucose. Such supply is mediated by the glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) protein. Paucity of the protein stemming from mutations in the associated {SLC2A1} gene deprives the brain of glucose and triggers the infantile-onset neurodevelopmental disorder, Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 {DS}). Considering the monogenic nature of Glut1 {DS}, the disease is relatively straightforward to model and thus study. Accordingly, Glut1 {DS} serves as a convenient paradigm to investigate the more general cellular and molecular consequences of brain energy failure. Here, we review how Glut1 {DS} models have informed the biology of a prototypical brain energy failure syndrome, how these models are facilitating the development of promising new treatments for the human disease, and how important insights might emerge from the study of Glut1 {DS} to illuminate the myriad conditions involving the Glut1 protein. \copyright 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {Binding of the spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) receptor triggers translocation of the virus into cells. Both the {ACE2} receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the {ACE2} receptor bound to the receptor binding domain ({RBD}) of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human {ACE2} receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike {RBD}. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the {RBD} of the {ACE2}-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds to a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our {MD} simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 fusion inhibitors. Copyright \copyright 2021 the Author(s).

The fact that the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE})-2 as the cell entry receptor and that hypertension as well as cardiovascular disorders frequently coexist with {COVID}-19 have generated considerable discussion on the management of patients with hypertension. In addition, the {COVID}-19 pandemic necessitates the development of and adaptation to a "New Normal" lifestyle, which will have a profound impact not only on communicable diseases but also on noncommunicable diseases, including hypertension. Summarizing what is known and what requires further investigation in this field may help to address the challenges we face. In the present review, we critically evaluate the existing evidence for the epidemiological association between {COVID}-19 and hypertension. We also summarize the current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection with an emphasis on {ACE2}, the cardiovascular system, and the kidney. Finally, we review evidence on the use of antihypertensive medication, namely, {ACE} inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, in patients with {COVID}-19.}

abstract = {The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has created the need for development of new therapeutic strategies. Understanding the mode of viral attachment, entry and replication has become a key aspect of such interventions. The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential for viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The S protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ({hACE2}) for entry. Herein, we describe glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of {hACE2} expressed in {HEK293} cells. We observed high glycan occupancy (73.2 to 100\%) at all seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly detected one novel O-glycosylation site. To deduce the detailed structure of glycan epitopes on {hACE2} that may be involved in viral binding, we have characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, the presence of bisecting {GlcNAc} and the pattern of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide and glycan spectrum, in addition to using bioinformatics tools to validate the {hACE2} glycosylation. Our elucidation of the site-specific glycosylation and its terminal orientations on the {hACE2} receptor, along with the modeling of {hACE2} glycosylation sites can aid in understanding the intriguing virus-receptor interactions and assist in the development of novel therapeutics to prevent viral entry. The relevance of studying the role of {ACE2} is further increased due to some recent reports about the varying {ACE2} dependent complications with regard to age, sex, race and pre-existing conditions of {COVID}-19 patients. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

abstract = {Based on available metabolomic studies, influenza infection affects a variety of cellular metabolic pathways to ensure an optimal environment for its replication and production of viral particles. Following infection, glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis increase in infected cells continually, which results in higher glucose consumption. The pentose phosphate shunt, as another glucose-consuming pathway, is enhanced by influenza infection to help produce more nucleotides, especially {ATP}. Regarding lipid species, following infection, levels of triglycerides, phospholipids, and several lipid derivatives undergo perturbations, some of which are associated with inflammatory responses. Also, mitochondrial fatty acid \beta-oxidation decreases significantly simultaneously with an increase in biosynthesis of fatty acids and membrane lipids. Moreover, essential amino acids are demonstrated to decline in infected tissues due to the production of large amounts of viral and cellular proteins. Immune responses against influenza infection, on the other hand, could significantly affect metabolic pathways. Mainly, interferon ({IFN}) production following viral infection affects cell function via alteration in amino acid synthesis, membrane composition, and lipid metabolism. Understanding metabolic alterations required for influenza virus replication has revealed novel therapeutic methods based on targeted inhibition of these cellular metabolic pathways. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.}

We also analyze structures for glycoforms representing those present in the nascent glycoproteins (prior to enzymatic modifications in the Golgi), as well as those that are commonly observed on antigens present in other viruses. These models were subjected to molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein. Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen ({HLA}) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the innate and adaptive immune response to the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus or to a related vaccine. The {3D} structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the notable exception of the {ACE2} receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform. Despite the relatively modest contribution of the glycans to the total molecular weight of the S trimer (17\% for the {HEK293} glycoform) they shield approximately 40\% of the protein surface.}

In this study we determined whether angiotensin {II}-mediated thrombosis occurs in arterioles and/or venules and assessed the involvement of type 1 ({AT}₁), type 2 ({AT}₂), and type 4 ({AT}₄) angiotensin {II} receptors, as well as receptors for endothelin 1 and bradykinin 1 and 2 in angiotensin {II}-enhanced microvascular thrombosis. Thrombus development in mouse cremaster microvessels was quantified after light/dye injury using the time of onset of the thrombus and time to blood flow cessation. Wild-type and {AT}₁ receptor-deficient mice were implanted with an angiotensin {II}-loaded {ALZET} pump for 2 weeks. Angiotensin {II} administration in both wild-type and {ATAT}₁ receptor-deficient mice significantly accelerated thrombosis in arterioles. Genetic deficiency and pharmacological antagonism of {AT}₁ receptors did not alter the thrombosis response to angiotensin {II}. Isolated murine platelets aggregated in response to low (picomolar) but not high (nanomolar) concentrations of angiotensin {II}. The platelet aggregation response to angiotensin {II} depended on {AT}₁ receptors. Antagonism of {AT}₂ receptors in vivo significantly prolonged the onset of angiotensin {II}-enhanced thrombosis, whereas an {AT}₄ receptor antagonist prolonged the time to flow cessation. Selective antagonism of either endothelin 1 or bradykinin 1 receptors largely prevented both the onset and flow cessation responses to chronic angiotensin {II} infusion. Our findings indicate that angiotensin {II} induced hypertension is accompanied by enhanced thrombosis in arterioles, and this response is mediated by a mechanism that involves {AT}₂, {AT}₄, bradykinin 1, and endothelin 1 receptor-mediated signaling.}

Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was defined by International Classification of Diseases-9-{CM} code. We used negative-binomial regression modeling to estimate the incidence of influenza-associated events. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: The incidence of influenza-associated acute respiratory failure was 2.7 per 100,000 person-years (95\% confidence interval, 0.2-23.5), and during the influenza season, 3.8\% of all respiratory failure hospitalizations were attributable to influenza. Compared with adults aged 18-49 years, the incidence rate ratio for influenza-associated acute respiratory failure was lower among children aged 1-4 (0.9) and 5-17 years (0.3); however, it was higher among adults aged 50-64 (4.8), 65-74 (10.4), 75-84 (19.9), and 85 years and older (33.7). Results were similar with more sensitive and specific outcome definitions and in a sensitivity analysis using only Arizona-specific outcome and surveillance data. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our data indicate that influenza was an important contributor to respiratory failure hospitalizations during 2003-2009. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for influenza among hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness when influenza is circulating in a community. Influenza has a greater effect on respiratory failure in the elderly, for whom better prevention measures are needed.}

abstract = {The glucose concentration of the airway surface liquid ({ASL}) is much lower than that in blood and is tightly regulated by the airway epithelium. {ASL} glucose is elevated in patients with viral colds, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. Elevated {ASL} glucose is also associated with increased incidence of respiratory infection. However, the mechanism by which {ASL} glucose increases under inflammatory conditions is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of proinflammatory mediators ({PIMs}) on the mechanisms governing airway glucose homeostasis in polarized monolayers of human airway (H441) and primary human bronchial epithelial ({HBE}) cells. Monolayers were treated with {TNF}-\alpha, {IFN}-\gamma, and {LPS} during 72 h. {PIM} treatment led to increase in {ASL} glucose concentration and significantly reduced H441 and {HBE} transepithelial resistance. This decline in transepithelial resistance was associated with an increase in paracellular permeability of glucose. Similar enhanced rates of paracellular glucose flux were also observed across excised trachea from {LPS}-treated mice. Interestingly, {PIMs} enhanced glucose uptake across the apical, but not the basolateral, membrane of H441 and {HBE} monolayers. This increase was predominantly via phloretin-sensitive glucose transporter ({GLUT})-mediated uptake, which coincided with an increase in {GLUT}-2 and {GLUT}-10 abundance. In conclusion, exposure of airway epithelial monolayers to {PIMs} results in increased paracellular glucose flux, as well as apical {GLUT}-mediated glucose uptake. However, uptake was insufficient to limit glucose accumulation in {ASL}. To our knowledge, these data provide for the first time a mechanism to support clinical findings that {ASL} glucose concentration is increased in patients with airway inflammation.}

Therefore, in this study the regulation of alveolar fluid clearance ({AFC}) and the expression of epithelial sodium channel ({ENaC}) by exogenous Ang {II} was verified. {SD} rats were anesthetized and were given Ang {II} with increasing doses (1, 10 and 100 μg/kg per min) via osmotic minipumps, whereas control rats received only saline vehicle. {AT1} receptor antagonist {ZD7155} (10 mg/kg) and inhibitor of {cAMP} degeneration rolipram (1 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 30 min before administration of Ang {II}. The lungs were isolated for measurement of alveolar fluid clearance. The {mRNA} and protein expression of {ENaC} were detected by {RT}-{PCR} and Western blot. Exposure to higher doses of Ang {II} reduced {AFC} in a dose-dependent manner and resulted in a non-coordinate regulation of \alpha-{ENaC} vs. the regulation of \beta- and \gamma-{ENaC}, however Ang {II} type 1 ({AT1}) receptor antagonist {ZD7155} prevented the Ang {II}-induced inhibition of fluid clearance and dysregulation of {ENaC} expression. In addition, exposure to inhibitor of {cAMP} degradation rolipram blunted the Ang {II}-induced inhibition of fluid clearance. These results indicate that through activation of {AT}(1) receptor, exogenous Ang {II} promotes pulmonary edema and alveolar filling by inhibition of alveolar fluid clearance via downregulation of {cAMP} level and dysregulation of {ENaC} expression.

An additional group of {ACE2}-knockout mice was fed a {SD} and treated with the {ACE} inhibitor, perindopril (2 mg kg(-1)day(-1)). Glucose and insulin tolerance tests, indirect calorimetry measurements and {EchoMRI} were performed. Non-esterfied 'free' fatty acid oxidation rate in skeletal muscle was calculated by measuring the palmitate oxidation rate. \beta-cell mass was determined by immunostaining. Insulin, collectrin, glucose transporter protein, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\gamma expression were analysed by {RT}-{PCR}. Markers of mithocondrial biogenesis/content were also evaluated. {MAIN} {FINDINGS}: {ACE2}-knockout mice showed a \beta-cell defect associated with low insulin and collectrin levels and reduced compensatory hypertrophy in response to a {HFD}, which were not reversed by perindopril. On the other hand, {ACE2} deficiency shifted energy metabolism towards glucose utilization, as it increased the respiratory exchange ratio, reduced palmitate oxidation and {PCG}-1\alpha expression in the skeletal muscle, where it up-regulated glucose transport proteins. Treatment of {ACE2}-knockout mice with perindopril reversed the skeletal muscle changes, suggesting that these were dependent on Angiotensin {II} (Ang {II}). {PRINCIPAL} {CONCLUSIONS}: {ACE2}-knockout mice display a \beta-cell defect, which does not seem to be dependent on Ang {II} but may reflect the collectrin-like action of {ACE2}. This defect seemed to be compensated by the fact that {ACE2}-knockout mice shifted their energy consumption towards glucose utilisation via Ang {II}. Copyright \copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) is a major factor for the high mortality associated with the disease. There is a paucity in the lung-specific biomarkers which diagnose these exacerbations. Surfactant protein D ({SP}-D) is a promising biomarker in predicting clinical outcomes for patients with {COPD}, is lung-specific and can be detected in serum. However, the profile in which serum concentrations of {SP}-D change during acute exacerbation is still unclear. This study aims to estimate and compare the concentrations of serum {SP}-D in patients with stable disease and during the exacerbation. {METHODS}: A cross-sectional study was conducted which composed of apparently healthy individuals (n = 28), which included 14 smokers and 14 nonsmokers, patients with stable {COPD} (n = 28), and patients experiencing acute exacerbations (n = 28). Pulmonary functions were performed for all groups. Serum {SP}-D concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}). These concentrations were compared by analysis of variance. {RESULTS}: Serum {SP}-D levels were significantly elevated in patients with acute exacerbations (508.733 ± 102.813 ng/ml) compared to patients with stable {COPD} (337.916 ± 86.265 ng/ml) and healthy subjects (177.313 ± 46.998 ng/ml; p \textless   0.001). Serum {SP}-D levels correlated inversely with lung function parameters including {FEV1\}%pred, {FVC\}%pred and {FEV1}/{FVC}. {CONCLUSION}: Serum {SP}-D levels are raised early on during acute exacerbations of {COPD}, which could be a potential early diagnostic biomarker for {COPD} exacerbations.}

abstract = {Influenza A viruses ({IAVs}) continue to pose major risks of morbidity and mortality during yearly epidemics and periodic pandemics. The genomic instability of {IAV} allows it to evade adaptive immune responses developed during prior infection. Of particular concern are pandemics which result from wholesale incorporation of viral genome sections from animal sources. These pandemic strains are radically different from circulating human strains and pose great risk for the human population. For these reasons, innate immunity plays a strong role in the initial containment of {IAV} infection. Soluble inhibitors present in respiratory lining fluids and blood provide a level of early protection against {IAV}. In general, these inhibitors act by binding to the viral hemagglutinin ({HA}). Surfactant protein D ({SP}-D) and mannose-binding lectin ({MBL}) attach to mannosylated glycans on the {HA} in a calcium dependent manner. In contrast, surfactant protein A, ficolins, and other inhibitors present sialic acid rich ligands to which the {HA} can bind. Among these inhibitors, {SP}-D seems to be the most potent due to its specific mode of binding to viral carbohydrates and its ability to strongly aggregate viral particles. We have studied specific properties of the N-terminal and collagen domain of {SP}-D that enable formation of highly multimerized molecules and cooperative binding among the multiple trimeric lectin domains in the protein. In addition, we have studied in depth the lectin activity of {SP}-D through expression of isolated lectin domains and targeted mutations of the {SP}-D lectin binding site. Through modifying specific residues around the saccharide binding pocket, antiviral activity of isolated lectin domains of {SP}-D can be markedly increased for seasonal strains of {IAV}. Wild-type {SP}-D causes little inhibition of pandemic {IAV}, but mutated versions of {SP}-D were able to inhibit pandemic {IAV} through enhanced binding to the reduced number of mannosylated glycans present on the {HA} of these strains. Through collaborative studies involving crystallography of isolated lectin domains of {SP}-D, glycomics analysis of the {HA}, and molecular modeling, the mechanism of binding of wild type and mutant forms of {SP}-D have been determined. These studies could guide investigation of the interactions of {SP}-D with other pathogens.}

Univariable logistic regression analysis showed that initial {FPG} after admission was associated with poor in-hospital outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that initial {FPG} after admission was an independent predictor of poor in-hospital outcome (odds ratio = 1.11, 95\% confidence interval: 1.037-1.188, P = .003).This study used {PSM} and strongly suggests that {FPG} is an independent predictive factor of poor in-hospital outcome in elderly patients with {AIS}.

abstract = {The airway epithelium maintains differential glucose concentrations between the airway surface liquid ({ASL}, \~0.4 {mM}) and the blood/interstitium (5-6 {mM}), which is important for defense against infection. Glucose primarily moves from the blood to the {ASL} via paracellular movement, down its concentration gradient, across the tight junctions. However, there is evidence that glucose can move transcellularly across epithelial cells. Using a Förster resonance energy transfer sensor for glucose, we investigated intracellular glucose concentrations in airway epithelial cells and the role of hexokinases in regulating intracellular glucose concentrations in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions. Our findings indicated that in airway epithelial cells (H441 or primary human bronchial epithelial cells) exposed to 5 {mM} glucose (normoglycemia), intracellular glucose concentration is in the micromolar range. Inhibition of facilitative glucose transporters ({GLUTs}) with cytochalasin B reduced intracellular glucose concentration. When cells were exposed to 15 {mM} glucose (hyperglycemia), intracellular glucose concentration was reduced. Airway cells expressed hexokinases I, {II}, and {III}. Inhibition with 3-bromopyruvate decreased hexokinase activity by 25\% and elevated intracellular glucose concentration, but levels remained in the micromolar range. Exposure to hyperglycemia increased glycolysis, glycogen, and sorbitol. Thus, glucose enters the airway cell via {GLUTs} and is then rapidly processed by hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent metabolic pathways to maintain low intracellular glucose concentrations. We propose that this prevents transcellular transport and aids the removal of glucose from the {ASL} and that the main route of entry for glucose into the {ASL} is via the paracellular pathway.}

Ketogenic diet primarily consists of the high amount of fats, a moderate amount of proteins, and very low carbohydrates. It is known to stimulate the metabolic effects of starvation by forcing the body to use primarily fat as a fuel source. Ketogenic diet was developed in the 1920s. Nowadays, it is gaining considerable attention as a potential weight-loss strategy because of the low-carb diet. However, it is being considered for use in several diseases/disorders also because of the beneficial effects on the metabolic health and nervous system. This review revisits the therapeutic potential of ketogenic diets in many pathological conditions and its role as a medical nutrition therapy. It also talks about the ill effects that the keto diet can have in case of self-usage and monitoring.}

Infection is normally confined to the upper respiratory tract but certain viral strains have evolved the ability to infect the lower respiratory tract, including the alveoli, leading to inflammation and a disease pattern of diffuse alveolar damage. Factors leading to this sequence of events are novel influenza strains, or strains that have viral proteins, in particular the {NS1} protein that allow it to escape the innate immune system. There are three main barriers that prevent infection of pneumocytes - mucin, host defence lectins and cells such as macrophages. Viruses have developed strategies such as neuraminidase and glycosylation patterns that allow this evasion. Though there has been much investment in antiviral drugs, it is proposed that more attention should be directed towards developing or utilizing compounds that enhance the ability of the innate immune system to combat viral infection.}

On the other hand, metformin, one of the most often used antidiabetic compounds has not only been shown to reduce the risk for vascular complications, but in addition these protective effects are largely independent of its well-known antihyperglycemic action. Therefore, to explain the vasculoprotective effects of metformin, a direct antioxidative action of this compound has been suggested. We show here that human endothelial cells ({HUVEC}) generate {ROI} not only in response to high glucose (30 mmol/l glucose), but also in response to palmitic acid, and advanced glycation end-products (carboxymethyllysine and S100 proteins). Metformin inhibited the production of {ROI} in response to all these stimuli. By double staining-dichlorofluorescein as marker of {ROI} and Mitotracker {CMH}-Ros for mitochondria-the mechanism of {ROI} generation was analyzed in more detail in smooth muscle cells. Our data suggest that {ROI} are generated by uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as by activation of the cytosolic {NADPH}-oxidase. A complete inhibition of {ROI} generation is only achieved by simultaneous inhibition of the mitochondrial electron flux (theonyltrifluoroacetone) and {NADPH}-oxidase (apocynin). Our data suggest that the various processes contributing to generation of {ROI} are closely linked. Activation of {AMP} kinase may represent an important mechanism to understand the antioxidative effects of metformin on the mitochondrial and cytosolic generation of {ROI}.}

abstract = {An important role of the alveolar epithelium is to contribute to the alveolocapillary barrier, secrete surfactant to lower the surface tension, and clear edema. These are energy-requiring processes for which normal oxygenation is required. There are many clinical conditions in which alveolar epithelial cells are exposed to low oxygen concentrations and although they can adapt to hypoxia, there are alterations in cellular function that can impact clinical outcomes. Hypoxic alveolar cells maintain cellular {ATP} content by increasing glycolytic capacity and via the hypoxia inducible factor-1 activation of a myriad of genes including the vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, they decrease {ATP} utilization by down regulating the high energy consuming Na,K-{ATPase} activity and protein synthesis. The alveolar epithelium is in close apposition to vascular endothelium, which facilitates efficient gas exchange and provides a physical barrier between luminal and interstitial/vascular spaces. Alveolar edema clearance is an active process requiring activity of many proteins of which the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel ({ENaC}) and Na,K-{ATPase} are important contributors. Exposure to hypoxia impairs alveolar edema clearance by mechanisms that down regulate both {ENaC} and the Na,K-{ATPase} function. Other effects of hypoxia on alveolar cell function include surfactant production, disruption of cytoskeleton integrity, and the triggering of apoptosis. In summary, hypoxia has deleterious effects on the alveolar epithelium. More research needs to be done to better understand the effects of hypoxia on alveolar epithelia cell and lung function.}

abstract = {The critically ill patient exhibits a well defined endocrine and metabolic adaptive response to stressor agents, characterized by incremented resting energy expenditure (hypermetabolism, which is believed to signify increased energy requirements), accelerated whole-body proteolysis (hypercatabolism), and lipolysis. These phenomena occur in the acute stage, which is also characterized by hyperglycemia, typically accompanied by a hyperdynamic cardiovascular reaction manifested by high cardiac output, increased oxygen consumption, high body temperature, and decrease peripheral vascular resistance. High provisions of glucose-derived calories tend to accentuate these reactions and increase the degree of hyperglycemia. We have adopted a hypocaloric-hyperproteic regimen which is provided only during the first days of the flow phase of the adaptive response to injury, sepsis, or critical illness. Our regimen includes a daily supply of 100 to 200 g of glucose and 1.5 to 2.0 g of protein (synthetic amino acids) per kilogram of ideal body weight. We have analyzed the data on 107 critically ill patients, 70 men and 37 women, who were admitted to the surgical intensive care unit and who received nutritional support by the {TPN} hypocaloric modality for a minimum of 3 days. We found that the high caloric loads contained in {TPN} regimens results in additional metabolic stress, with consequent hyperdynamic cardiorespiratory repercussion, high {CO2} production, and frequently hepatic steatosis. In contrast, our hypocaloric-hyperproteic approach has resulted in a more physiologic clinical course and considerable reduction in cost. The infusion of high glucose loads, such as those used in hypercaloric {TPN}, does not seem to suppress the excessive endogenous production of glucose but instead markedly exacerbates the hyperglycemia of the postinjury and acute stress condition. We believe that the hypocaloric-hyperproteic regimen we utilize during the first few days of the stress situation is more in accordance with the inflammatory and hormonal mediator climate of the initial stages of the flow phase and thus appears to be beneficial vis-à-vis the hypercaloric loads that many use as routine metabolic support in critically ill patients.}

abstract = {Why diabetes is associated with abnormally high susceptibility to infection remains unknown, although two major antibacterial proteins, lysozyme and lactoferrin, have now been shown to specifically bind glucose-modified proteins bearing advanced glycation end products ({AGEs}). Exposure to {AGE}-modified proteins inhibits the enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme, and blocks the bacterial agglutination and bacterial killing activities of lactoferrin. Peptide mapping revealed a single {AGE} binding domain in lysozyme and two {AGE} binding domains in lactoferrin; each domain contains a 17- to 18- amino acid cysteine-bounded loop motif ({CX15}-{16C}) that is markedly hydrophilic. Synthetic peptides corresponding to these motifs in lysozyme and lactoferrin exhibited {AGE} binding activity, and similar domains are also present in other antimicrobial proteins. These results suggest that elevated levels of {AGEs} in tissues and serum of diabetic patients may inhibit endogenous antibacterial proteins by binding to this conserved {AGE}-binding cysteine-bounded domain '{ABCD}' motif, thereby increasing susceptibility to bacterial infections in the diabetic population.}

All of these factors may affect lung surfactant function. To verify the {pH} dependence of surface activity of pulmonary surfactant, we studied the in vitro effects of {pH} and Ca2+ on the surface tension-lowering abilities of various surfactants in an oscillating bubble surfactometer. Surface tension measurements were made of mixtures at known {pHs} or after the replacement of the subphase fluid of surfactant films with buffered saline at various {pH} values. At the {pH} range 4.0-7.0, the average equilibrium surface tension ({EST})/minimum surface tension ({MST}) for natural surfactants human amniotic fluid and natural lung surfactant from rabbit lung lavage was 24/2 {mN}/m. At the same {pH} range, Exosurf and phospholipids alone had an {EST}/{MST} of 44/25 and 44/12 {mN}/m, respectively. Survanta ({SUR}) containing {SP}-B and {SP}-C and a phospholipid surfactant ({KL4}) containing a leucine/lysine peptide had an {EST}/{MST} of 29/5 and 36/3, respectively. Alkalinization of the subphase ({pH} \textgreater 7.4) significantly decreased the surface tension-lowering ability of {SUR} (P \textless 0.01) and to a lesser extent that of {KL4} surfactant (P \textless 0.05), but natural lung surfactants were not significantly affected over a {pH} range of 3-7.5. These data demonstrate that natural surfactants maintain their optimal surface activities over a broader {pH} range than do the commercial products because of a lack of {SP}-A. Careful monitoring of the {pH} for optimal surface activity is recommended when evaluating surfactant function and the effects of specific inhibitors on this function.}

Neutrophil dysfunction resulting from {IAV} exposure was diminished when the virus was pre-incubated with {SP}-D. Each of these effects was mediated by the calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding property of {SP}-D. Native {SP}-D preparations of both human and rat origin, as well as recombinant rat {SP}-D, had similar activity. {SP}-A also inhibited {IAV} hemagglutination activity. We have previously reported that related mammalian serum lectins (mannose-binding lectin [{MBL}] and conglutinin) have similar effects. {SP}-D was at least 10-fold more potent at causing hemagglutination inhibition than were {SP}-A or {MBL}. {SP}-D was shown to contribute to potent anti-{IAV} activity of human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

Their expression of pattern recognition receptors ({PRRs}), such as Toll-like receptors ({TLRs}) and C-type lectin receptors ({CLRs}), enables antigen recognition and mediates appropriate immune responses. Distinct subsets of human {DCs} have been identified; however their expression of {PRRs} is not fully clarified. Expressions of {CLRs} by {DC} subpopulations, in particular, remain elusive. This study aimed to identify and compare {PRR} expressions on human blood {DC} subsets, including {CD1c}(+) , {CD141}(+) and {CD16}(+) myeloid {DCs} and {CD123}(+) plasmacytoid {DCs}, in order to understand their capacity to recognize different antigens as well as their responsiveness to {PRR}-directed targeting. Whole blood was obtained from 13 allergic and six non-allergic individuals. Mononuclear cells were purified and multi-colour flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of 10 {CLRs} and two {TLRs} on distinct {DC} subsets. {PRR} expression levels were shown to differ between {DC} subsets for each {PRR} assessed. Furthermore, principal component analysis and random forest test demonstrated that the {PRR} profiles were discriminative between {DC} subsets. Interestingly, {CLEC9A} was expressed at lower levels by {CD141}(+) {DCs} from allergic compared with non-allergic donors. The subset-specific {PRR} expression profiles suggests individual responsiveness to {PRR}-targeting and supports functional specialization. \copyright 2014 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.}

Glucose is not normally detectable in airway secretions but appears as blood glucose levels exceed 6.7-9.7 mmol/l. We hypothesise that the presence of glucose in airway secretions in these patients predisposes to respiratory infection. {METHODS}: An association between glucose in bronchial aspirates and nosocomial respiratory infection was examined in 98 critically ill patients. Patients were included if they were expected to require ventilation for more than 48 hours. Bronchial aspirates were analysed for glucose and sent twice weekly for microbiological analysis and whenever an infection was suspected. {RESULTS}: Glucose was detected in bronchial aspirates of 58 of the 98 patients. These patients were more likely to have pathogenic bacteria than patients without glucose detected in bronchial aspirates (relative risk 2.4 (95\% {CI} 1.5 to 3.8)). Patients with glucose were much more likely to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}) than those without glucose in bronchial aspirates (relative risk 2.1 (95\% {CI} 1.2 to 3.8)). Patients who became colonised or infected with {MRSA} had more infiltrates on their chest radiograph (p\textless 0.001), an increased C reactive protein level (p\textless 0.05), and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (p\textless 0.01).

Unexpectedly, we found that {PI3K} inhibitors could suppress {COX}-2 expression, {PGE2} production, caspase-3 activity, and the subsequent apoptosis under {HG} condition. Glucose-induced activation of {PI3K} resulted in the downstream effector Akt phosphorylation. {PI3K} inhibitors effectively attenuated the intracellular reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) generation and nuclear factor {kappaB} ({NF}-{kappaB}) activation. Blocking the {PI3K} and Akt activities with the dominant-negative vectors greatly diminished the {HG}-triggered {NF}-{kappaB} activation and {COX}-2 expression and apoptosis. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results suggest that {HG}, via {PI3K}/Akt signaling, induces {NF}-{kappaB}-related upregulation of {COX}-2, which in turn triggers the caspase-3 activity that facilitates {HUVEC} apoptosis.

abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: Viruses rely on host cellular metabolism to provide the energy and biosynthetic building blocks required for their replication. Dengue virus ({DENV}), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is one of the most important arthropod-borne human pathogens worldwide. We analyzed global intracellular metabolic changes associated with {DENV} infection of primary human cells. Our metabolic profiling data suggested that central carbon metabolism, particularly glycolysis, is strikingly altered during a time course of {DENV} infection. Glucose consumption is increased during {DENV} infection and depriving {DENV}-infected cells of exogenous glucose had a pronounced impact on viral replication. Furthermore, the expression of both glucose transporter 1 and hexokinase 2, the first enzyme of glycolysis, is upregulated in {DENV}-infected cells. Pharmacologically inhibiting the glycolytic pathway dramatically reduced {DENV} {RNA} synthesis and infectious virion production, revealing a requirement for glycolysis during {DENV} infection. Thus, these experiments suggest that {DENV} induces the glycolytic pathway to support efficient viral replication. This study raises the possibility that metabolic inhibitors, such as those that target glycolysis, could be used to treat {DENV} infection in the future. {IMPORTANCE}: Approximately 400 million people are infected with dengue virus ({DENV}) annually, and more than one-third of the global population is at risk of infection. As there are currently no effective vaccines or specific antiviral therapies for {DENV}, we investigated the impact {DENV} has on the host cellular metabolome to identify metabolic pathways that are critical for the virus life cycle. We report an essential role for glycolysis during {DENV} infection. {DENV} activates the glycolytic pathway, and inhibition of glycolysis significantly blocks infectious {DENV} production. This study provides further evidence that viral metabolomic analyses can lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets to block the replication of medically important human pathogens.

abstract = {In health, the glucose concentration of airway surface liquid ({ASL}) is 0.4 {mM}, about 12 times lower than the blood glucose concentration. Airway glucose homeostasis comprises a set of processes that actively maintain low {ASL} glucose concentration against the transepithelial gradient. Tight junctions between airway epithelial cells restrict paracellular glucose movement. Epithelial cellular glucose transport and metabolism removes glucose from {ASL}. Low {ASL} glucose concentrations make an important contribution to airway defense against infection, limiting bacterial growth by restricting nutrient availability. Both airway inflammation, which increases glucose permeability of tight junctions, and hyperglycemia, which increases the transepithelial glucose gradient, increase {ASL} glucose concentrations, with the greatest effect seen where they coexist. Elevated {ASL} glucose drives proliferation of bacteria able to use glucose as a carbon source, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacteria. Clinically, this appears to be important in driving exacerbations of chronic lung disease, especially in patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus. Drugs can restore airway glucose homeostasis by reducing the permeability of tight junctions (eg, metformin), increasing epithelial cell glucose transport (eg, \beta-agonists, insulin), and/or by lowering blood glucose (eg, dapagliflozin). In cell culture and animal models these reduce {ASL} glucose concentrations and limit bacterial growth, preventing infection. Observational studies in humans indicate that airway glucose homeostasis-modifying drugs could prevent chronic lung disease exacerbations if tested in randomized trials.

They are vital to maintaining steady-state respiration in the human lung based on their ability to clear airways while also directing tolerogenic or inflammatory responses based on specific stimuli. Over the past three decades, studies have determined that there are multiple subsets of these two general cell types that exist in the airways and interstitium. Identifying these numerous subsets has proven challenging, especially with the unique microenvironments present in the lung. Cells found in the vasculature are not the same subsets found in the skin or the lung, as demonstrated by surface marker expression. By transcriptional profiling, these subsets show similarities but also major differences. Primary human lung cells and/ or tissues are difficult to acquire, particularly in a healthy condition. Additionally, surface marker screening and transcriptional profiling are continually identifying new {DC} and M\phi subsets. While the overall field is moving forward, we emphasize that more attention needs to focus on replicating the steady-state microenvironment of the lung to reveal the physiological functions of these subsets.}

abstract = {Mucus clearance is an important component of the lung's innate defense against disease, and the ability of the airways to clear mucus is strongly dependent on the volume of liquid on airway surfaces. Whether airway surface liquid ({ASL}) volume is maintained by passive surface forces or by active ion transport is controversial yet crucial to the understanding of how this system operates in both health and disease. In support of active ion transport being the major determinant of {ASL} volume, we have demonstrated that normal airway epithelia sense and autoregulate {ASL} height (volume) by adjusting the rates of Na+ absorption and Cl- secretion to maintain mucus transport.}

abstract = {The aim of the present study is to investigate changes of interferon ({IFN}) production occurring over the first 48 h after infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}) with severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) coronavirus ({CoV}) and to compare these changes to those induced by well-established {IFN}-inducing viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis ({VSV}) and Newcastle viruses ({NDV}). Experiments have been carried out using {PBMCs} of 10 different healthy donors. The results showed that the antiviral activity of {IFN} contained in the supernatant of {SARS}-{CoV}-infected {PBMCs} was lower than those induced by {VSV} and {NDV}. Consequently, {SARS}-{CoV} induces a lower synthesis of {IFN}-alpha, -beta and -gamma compared to {VSV} and {NDV}. Characterization of the profile of {IFN}-alpha subtypes genes expression in {SARS}-{CoV}-infected {PBMCs} demonstrated that the level of {IFN}-alpha2 and -6 subtypes were higher compared to other {IFN}-alpha subtypes namely, {IFN}-alpha5, -8, -10, -13/1, -17, and -21. In conclusion, {SARS}-{CoV} induces {IFNs} to a less extent compared to {VSV} and {NDV}, thus suggesting that the {IFN} system does play a limited role in early host defense against {SARS}-{CoV} infection.

Of these, 214 were admitted to isolation wards and 41were admitted to intensive care units ({ICUs}). Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were collected and compared between {ICU} and non-{ICU} patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore the risk factors associated with poor clinical outcomes ({ICU} admission or death). {RESULTS}: There were significant changes in several clinical parameters in {ICU} patients (leukopenia, lymphopenia, elevated D-dimer, as well as higher levels of {FPG}, cardiac troponin, serum ferritin, {IL}-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein)compared with non-{ICU} patients. The prevalence of known diabetes was substantially higher in {ICU} than non-{ICU} patients (31.7\% vs. 17.8\%, P = 0.0408). Multivariable regression analysis showed that a history of diabetes [odds ratio ({OR}), 0.099; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 0.016-0.627; P = 0.014], high {FPG} at admission ({OR}, 1.587; 95\% {CI}, 1.299-1.939, P \textless  0.001), high {IL}-6 ({OR}, 1.01; 95\% {CI}, 1.002-1.018, P = 0.013), and D-dimer higher than 1 mg/L at admission ({OR}, 4.341; 95\% {CI}, 1.139-16.547, P = 0.032) were independent predictors of poor outcomes. Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that compared with {FPG} \textless  7 mmol/L, {FPG} levels of 7.0-11.1 mmol/L and ≥ 11.1 mmol/L were associated with an increased hazard ratio ({HR}) for poor outcome ({HR}, 5.538 [95\% {CI}, 2.269-13.51] and {HR}, 11.55 [95\% {CI}, 4.45-29.99], respectively). {CONCLUSION}: Hyperglycemia and a history of diabetes on admission predicted poor clinical outcomes in {COVID}-19.

Patients with diabetes are particularly vulnerable and more likely to get severe complications when infected with this virus. Although the information continues to emerge, here we provide our perspective on initial outcomes observed in hospitalized patients with diabetes and the potential role played by the proinflammatory metabolic state in these patients that promotes fertile ground for the virus' inflammatory surge, resulting in severe insulin resistance and severe hyperglycemia. The rapidly evolving renal failure, hypotension, pressor and steroid use, and variable nutritional support further complicates their management. Thus, timely implementation of glucose management protocols addressing these complex scenarios while also following {COVID}-19-related trajectories in inflammatory biomarkers and being cognizant of the health care provider exposure may substantially affect morbidity and mortality. \copyright 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.}

Diabetes, obesity, and hypertension have, as minor common denominators, chronic low-grade inflammation and high plasma myeloperoxidase levels, which could be linked to pulmonary phagocytic hyperactivation and {C\SS}. The hyperactivation of M1 macrophages with a proinflammatory phenotype, which is linked to aerobic glycolysis, leads to the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets from circulating blood and plays a crucial role in thrombo-inflammation (as recently demonstrated in {COVID}-19) through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and monocyte-platelet aggregates, which could be responsible for {DIC}. The modulation of glucose availability for activated M1 macrophages by means of a eucaloric ketogenic diet ({EKD}) could represent a possible metabolic tool for reducing adenosine triphosphate production from aerobic glycolysis in the M1 macrophage phenotype during the exudative phase. This approach could reduce the overproduction of cytokines and, consequently, the accumulation of neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets from the blood. Second, an {EKD} could be advantageous for the metabolism of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages because these cells predominantly express oxidative phosphorylation enzymes and are best fed by the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria. An {EKD} could guarantee the availability of free fatty acids, which are an optimal fuel supply for these cells. Third, an {EKD}, which could reduce high lactate formation by macrophages due to glycolysis, could favor the production of interferon type I, which are inhibited by excessive lactate production. From a practical point of view, the hypothesis, in addition to being proven in clinical studies, must obviously take into account the contraindications of an {EKD}, particularly type 1 or 2 diabetes treated with drugs that can cause hypoglycemia, to avoid the risk for side effects of the diet.

abstract = {Objective: The present study aimed at investigating the clinical risk factors for {COVID}-19 patients developing from moderate condition to severe condition, and providing reference for early intervention and prognosis. Methods: We collected the clinical data of 24 patients with moderate-to-severe {COVID}-19 who were admitted to the isolation ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College from January, 2020 to February 20, 2020, and evaluated the data of clinical characteristics, blood test results, inflammatory index, chest {CT} imaging characteristics, and antiviral treatment, comparing this with the clinical data of 41 patients with moderate condition in the same period. From this comparison we thus summarized the current knowledge of potential risk factors for {COVID}-19 patients developing from moderate to severe condition. Results: (1) Clinical characteristics: The moderate-to-severe group and the moderate group in terms of combined common underlying diseases and respiratory frequency showed significant difference statistically (t-value were 13.32, 6.17, respectively, P \textless 0.05), while no significant difference between the two groups in gender, age, or clinical symptoms was statistically observed(P \textgreater 0.05). (2) Analysis of blood test results: The lymphocyte count and plasma albumin of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly lower than those of the moderate group (t-values were 4.16, 4.11, respectively, P \textless 0.05), and the blood glucose and urea of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly higher than those of the moderate group (t-value were 3.27, 4.19, respectively, P \textless 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in terms of white blood cell count ({WBC}), platelet count ({PLT}), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase ({GPT}) (P \textgreater 0.05). (3) Comparison of inflammatory indicators: The level of {IL}-6 and {CRP} of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly higher than those of the moderate group (t-values were 2.84, 4.88, respectively, P \textless 0.05). (4) Imaging comparison: As for patients with moderate {COVID}-19, the imaging manifestations were the concurrence of ground-glass opacity, patchy shadow, and consolidation shadow in both lungs, diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lungs accompanied by air bronchogram, and large area consolidation of both lungs with pulmonary interstitial changes. The possibility for these patients to develop into severe condition increased, and the differences were statistically significant (t = 10.92, P \textless 0.05). (5) Clinical antiviral treatment: There was no statistically significant difference in the combination of two or three antiviral drugs between the two groups (\chi2 = 0.05, P \textgreater 0.05). Conclusion: Current evidence suggested that the combination of common underlying diseases, respiratory frequency, lymphocyte count, blood glucose, albumin, urea level, inflammatory factors ({CRP}, {IL}-6), and imaging manifestations collectively contributed to the potential risk factors for the development of {COVID}-19 from moderate condition to severe condition. Particular attention should be paid to early detection and intervention during clinical work, which will be of vital significance to the ascent of the recovery rate as well as the reduction of mortality.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In hypertension clinics, screening patients for the metabolic syndrome ({MetS}) is common practice, while performing the cumbersome oral glucose tolerance test ({OGTT}) is not. How large is the underestimation of diabetes and prediabetes that ensues is unknown. {METHODS}: We recruited N=1397 patients with essential arterial hypertension who underwent a 75-g {OGTT} and were classified as normally glucotolerant ({NGT}) or having impaired glucose metabolism ({IGM}), and as affected or not by {MetS} ({ATPIII} criteria). The agreement between the {OGTT} and the {ATPIII} criteria in attributing a high cardiovascular risk was estimated by matching the categories of {MetS} and no-{MetS} with {NGT} and {IGM}. {RESULTS}: n=677/1397 patients (48\%) satisfied criteria for {MetS}, while n=757/1397 (54\%) had an {IGM}. {MetS} and {IGM} were both present in n=512/1397 patients (36.6\%), and both absent in n=475/1397 (34\%). Further n=410/1397 patients (29\%) were discordant for the two conditions: n=165/410 (40\%) had the {MetS} but were {NGT}, and n=245/410 (60\%) had {IGM} but no {MetS}. Among {IGM} patients, n=168/757 (22\%; of which 45 had no {MetS}) received a new diagnosis of diabetes based on {OGTT} criteria. Among all discordant patients, those with {IGM} and no {MetS} were more commonly males (p\textless 0.001), and had older age (p\textless 0.001) and lower body mass index (p\textless 0.05). {CONCLUSIONS}: Among patients with hypertension, the estimate of the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes, hence of the global cardiovascular risk, can be seriously flawed unless an {OGTT} is performed. Our results support a wider use of the {OGTT} in the management of hypertension. Copyright \copyright 2014 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

Physiological ageing is associated with increased plasma levels of many proteins of blood coagulation together with fibrinolysis impairment. This may be of great concern in view of the known association between vascular and thromboembolic diseases and ageing. On the other hand, centenarians are characterized by a state of hypercoagulability and possession of several high-risk alleles and well-known atherothrombotic risk markers but this appears to be compatible with longevity and/or health. Parameters considered risk factors for atherosclerotic vascular diseases in young people may lose their biological significance in advanced age and assume a different role.}

Indeed, despite the blood vessels being exposed to high pressures in hypertension, the complications of hypertension are paradoxically thrombotic in nature rather than haemorrhagic. The evidence suggests that hypertension appears to confer a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state, which can be related to conventional risk factors, target organ damage, complications and long-term prognosis, as well as different antihypertensive treatments. Further work is needed to examine the mechanisms leading to this phenomenon, the potential prognostic and treatment implications, and the possible value of measuring these parameters in routine clinical practice.}

We examined the systemic and intrarenal {RAS} status of aging normal rats and responses to suppression and stimulation of the production of endogenous {ANG} {II}. Studies were performed in young (3 mo) and early aging (15 mo) male Sprague-Dawley rats. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors modestly decreased mean arterial pressure ({MAP}) in young (3 mo) and early aging (15 mo) rats and limited proteinuria in the older rats. There were no significant age-related effects on renal function or on endogenous {RAS} activity. Intravenous infusion of the precursor {ANG} I led to comparable increases in {MAP} in younger and older rats. In contrast, the renal effects (reduction in glomerular filtration and plasma flow rates) were exaggerated in the older animals. Intrarenal arterial {ANG} I did not affect {MAP} in any group. In young rats, there were no significant hemodynamic effects in either the ipsilateral (infused) or the contralateral (noninfused) kidney. In the older rats, both kidneys had a significant fall in renal renal plasma flow rate ({RPF}) with left renal arterial infusion of {ANG} I. Accordingly, these studies early in the course of aging found only subtle changes in the activity, responsiveness, and metabolism of the {RAS}. Thus early aging is associated with a modest but important increase in sensitivity to {RAS} stimulation.}

In prospective trials, the effects of antihypertensive agents on insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism have been evaluated. Both beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics worsen insulin resistance and deteriorate lipoprotein metabolism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors, Ca2(+)-channel blockers, and alpha-blockers are neutral or improve these factors. These data may explain the unexpectedly high incidence of the development of diabetes among treated hypertensives and the poor effect on risk for coronary heart disease in intervention trials.}

abstract = {People with cystic fibrosis ({CF}) who develop related diabetes ({CFRD}) have accelerated pulmonary decline, increased infection with antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and increased pulmonary exacerbations. We have previously shown that glucose concentrations are elevated in airway surface liquid ({ASL}) of people with {CF}, particularly in those with {CFRD}. We therefore explored the hypotheses that glucose homeostasis is altered in {CF} airway epithelia and that elevation of glucose flux into {ASL} drives increased bacterial growth, with an effect over and above other cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR})-related {ASL} abnormalities. The aim of this study was to compare the mechanisms governing airway glucose homeostasis in {CF} and non-{CF} primary human bronchial epithelial ({HBE}) monolayers, under normal conditions and in the presence of Ps. aeruginosa filtrate. {HBE}-bacterial co-cultures were performed in the presence of 5 {mM} or 15 {mM} basolateral glucose to investigate how changes in blood glucose, such as those seen in {CFRD}, affects luminal Ps. aeruginosa growth. Calu-3 cell monolayers were used to evaluate the potential importance of glucose on Ps. aeruginosa growth, in comparison to other hallmarks of the {CF} {ASL}, namely mucus hyperviscosity and impaired {CFTR}-dependent fluid secretions. We show that elevation of basolateral glucose promotes the apical growth of Ps. aeruginosa on {CF} airway epithelial monolayers more than non-{CF} monolayers. Ps. aeruginosa secretions elicited more glucose flux across {CF} airway epithelial monolayers compared to non-{CF} monolayers which we propose increases glucose availability in {ASL} for bacterial growth. In addition, elevating basolateral glucose increased Ps. aeruginosa growth over and above any {CFTR}-dependent effects and the presence or absence of mucus in Calu-3 airway epithelia-bacteria co-cultures. Together these studies highlight the importance of glucose as an additional factor in promoting Ps. aeruginosa growth and respiratory infection in {CF} disease.}

abstract = {Glucose in airway surface liquid ({ASL}) is maintained at low concentrations compared to blood glucose. Using radiolabelled [(3)H]-D: -glucose and [(14)C]-L: -glucose, detection of D: - and L: -glucose by high-performance liquid chromatography and metabolites by nuclear magnetic resonance, we found that glucose applied to the basolateral side of H441 human airway epithelial cell monolayers at a physiological concentration (5 {mM}) crossed to the apical side by paracellular diffusion. Transepithelial resistance of the monolayer was inversely correlated with paracellular diffusion. Appearance of glucose in the apical compartment was reduced by uptake of glucose into the cell by basolateral and apical phloretin-sensitive {GLUT} transporters. Glucose taken up into the cell was metabolised to lactate which was then released, at least in part, across the apical membrane. We suggest that glucose transport through {GLUT} transporters and its subsequent metabolism in lung epithelial cells help to maintain low glucose concentrations in human {ASL} which is important for protecting the lung against infection.}

Effective mucociliary clearance requires appropriate mucus production and coordinated ciliary activity. The important role of these two components is best demonstrated in disorders such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis, both of which lead to lifelong recurrent respiratory tract infections. We review the methods used to analyze mucociliary clearance. {RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Utilization of microdialysis probes has improved temporal resolution of mucociliary clearance in murine airways, availing many genetic mouse models to critical mucociliary clearance analysis, while improved fixation technique for transmission electron microscopy has allowed for detailed resolution of the airway surface liquid. High-speed digital video analysis has improved quantification of ciliary beat frequency while advancements in air-liquid interface culturing techniques have generated in-vitro models to investigate mucociliary clearance. {SUMMARY}: Advancements in techniques for analysis of mucociliary clearance have improved our understanding of the interaction between the respiratory epithelium and the airway surface liquid, resulting in the ability to study pathologic processes involving mucociliary clearance in great detail.}

Paradoxically, however, potent broadly neutralizing antibodies ({bnAbs}) that target this shield have been isolated. The unusually high glycan density on the gp120 subunit limits processing during biosynthesis, leaving a region of under-processed oligomannose-type structures, which is a primary target of these {bnAbs}. Here we investigate the contribution of individual glycosylation sites in the formation of this so-called intrinsic mannose patch. Deletion of individual sites has a limited effect on the overall size of the intrinsic mannose patch but leads to changes in the processing of neighbouring glycans. These structural changes are largely tolerated by a panel of glycan-dependent {bnAbs} targeting these regions, indicating a degree of plasticity in their recognition. These results support the intrinsic mannose patch as a stable target for vaccine design.}

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the impact of corticosteroid treatment on outcomes of patients with influenza virus infection. The {PubMed}, {EMBASE}, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to February, 2015. Studies comparing corticosteroid treatment with no corticosteroid treatment in patients with influenza virus infection were included. The primary outcomes assessed were the association of mortality and nosocomial infection with corticosteroid treatment. Two authors independently extracted the data. {ORs} and weighted mean differences ({WMDs}) were used to describe dichotomous data and continuous data, respectively. Nineteen studies with 4916 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that corticosteroid treatment was significantly associated with mortality ({OR} 1.98, 95\% {CI} 1.62-2.43, p \textless 0.00001) and nosocomial infection ({OR} 3.16, 95\% {CI} 2.09-4.78, p \textless 0.00001). The durations of mechanical ventilation ({WMD} 3.82, 95\% {CI} 1.49-6.15, p 0.001) and intensive-care unit stay ({WMD} 4.78, 95\% {CI} 2.27-7.29, p 0.0002) were both markedly longer in the corticosteroid treatment group than in the control group. These findings suggest that routine steroid use may not be ideal for influenza virus infection. However, these results are derived from observational studies, with some important biases. They should be examined in future sufficiently powered randomized trials. Copyright \copyright 2015 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The epithelium has many critical roles in homeostasis, including an essential responsibility in establishing tissue barriers. In addition to the fundamental role in separating internal from external environment, epithelial barriers maintain nutrient, fluid, electrolyte and metabolic waste balance in multiple organs. While, by definition, barrier function is conserved, the structure of the epithelium varies across organs. For example, the skin barrier is a squamous layer of cells with distinct structural features, while the lung barrier is composed of a very thin single cell to minimize diffusion space. With the increased focus on age-dependent alterations in organ structure and function, there is an emerging interest in the impact of age on epithelial barriers. This review will focus on the impact of aging on the epithelial barrier of several organs, including the skin, lung, gastrointestinal tract and the kidney, at a structural and functional level.}

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is characterized by long standing hyperglycemia leading to numerous life-threatening complications. For type 1 diabetes mellitus, resulting from selective destruction of insulin producing cells by exaggerated immune reaction, the only effective therapy remains exogenous insulin administration. Despite accurate compliance to treatment of certain patients, transient episodes of hyperglycemia cannot be completely eliminated by this symptomatic treatment. Novel immunotherapeutic approaches based on tolerogenic dendritic cells, T regulatory cells and mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) have been tested in clinical trials, endeavoring to directly modulate the autoimmune destruction process in pancreas. However, hyperglycemia itself affects the immune system and the final efficacy of cell-based immunotherapies could be affected by the different glycemic control of enrolled patients. The present review explores the impact of hyperglycemia on immune cells while providing greater insight into the molecular mechanisms of high glucose action and subsequent metabolic reprogramming of different immune cells. Furthermore, over-production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, formation of advanced glycation end products as a consequence of hyperglycemia and their downstream signalization in immune cells are also discussed. Since hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus might have an impact on immune-interventional treatment, the maintenance of a tight glucose control seems to be beneficial in patients considered for cell-based therapy.}

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) is responsible for 31\% of all global deaths. Atherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular disease and is a chronic inflammatory disorder in the arteries. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol, extracellular matrix, and immune cells in the vascular wall. Recently, the collectin surfactant protein-D ({SP}-D), an important regulator of the pulmonary immune response, was found to be expressed in the vasculature. Several in vitro studies have examined the role of {SP}-D in the vascular inflammation leading to atherosclerosis. These studies show that {SP}-D plays a dual role in the development of atherosclerosis. In general, {SP}-D shows anti-inflammatory properties, and dampens local inflammation in the vessel, as well as systemic inflammation. However, {SP}-D can also exert a pro-inflammatory role, as it stimulates C-C chemokine receptor 2 inflammatory blood monocytes to secrete tumor necrosis-factor \alpha and increases secretion of interferon-\gamma from natural killer cells. In vivo studies examining the role of {SP}-D in the development of atherosclerosis agree that {SP}-D plays a proatherogenic role, with {SP}-D knockout mice having smaller atherosclerotic plaque areas, which might be caused by a decreased systemic inflammation. Clinical studies examining the association between {SP}-D and cardiovascular disease have reported a positive association between circulatory {SP}-D level, carotid intima-media thickness, and coronary artery calcification. Other studies have found that circulatory {SP}-D is correlated with increased risk of both total and cardiovascular disease mortality. Both in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies examining the relationship between {SP}-D and {CVDs} will be discussed in this review. Copyright \copyright 2019 Colmorten, Nexoe and Sorensen.}

Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunit. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, completely of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells, regardless of the glycosites' location. Moreover, the N-glycan compositions were conserved among different sizes of subunits. Our study indicate that the S protein N-glycosylation occurs regularly at each site, albeit the occupied N-glycans were diverse and heterogenous. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.

Severe {COVID}-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock leading to death. These complications are thought to result from an overactivation of the immune system, leading to a cytokine storm syndrome associated with multiple organ failure. Here, we report that high mobility group box 1 ({HMGB1}), a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern ({DAMP}) and a central mediator of lethal inflammation, could be a potential target for innovative therapeutic strategies for {COVID}-19. Serum {HMGB1} in severe {COVID}-19 patients is elevated (189.40 ± 140.88 ng/ml). Exogenous {HMGB1} induces the expression of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 entry receptor {ACE2} in alveolar epithelial cells in an {AGER}-dependent manner. Importantly, genetic (using {AGER} {siRNA}) or pharmacological (using glycyrrhizin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and {FPS}-{ZM1}) inhibition of the {HMGB1}-{AGER} pathway blocks {ACE2} expression. Thus, {HMGB1} inhibitors are likewise promising drug candidates for the treatment of patients suffering from {COVID}-19. \copyright 2020 The Author(s).}

Differential scanning calorimetry measurements on the thermal denaturation of the lectins and their carbohydrate complexes show that the Con A tetramer dissociates into monomers, while the pea and lentil lectin dimers dissociate into two submonomer fragments. At the denaturation temperature, one carbohydrate binds to each monomer of Con A and the pea and lentil lectins. Complexation with the carbohydrate increases the denaturation temperature of the lectin and the magnitude of the increases yield binding constants in agreement with the determinations from titration calorimetry.}

This effect could be related either to the binding of the alpha-dicarbonyls, methylglyoxal ({MG}) or 3-deoxyglucosone, or to an increase in enzymatic detoxification. Our studies presented in this manuscript document extracellular binding of {MG} by metformin to form a specific product (triazepinone) in vivo. This condensation product appears to be only one of several inactive end products resulting from this chemical reaction and we discuss the possibility that these or other condensation products (hydroimidazolones) could be indicative of inactivation of {MG} by metformin. Additional studies of other possible condensation products, as well as other potential cellular effects of metformin on {MG} production, will help to clarify this potentially important effect of metformin and provide a further rationale for using metformin to prevent long-term complications.}

These two variants have mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein namely {N501Y} ({UK}, {SA}), {K417N} ({SA}) and {E484K} ({SA}).

The present study showed that {AGEs} significantly promoted macrophages to express {IL}-6 and {TNF}-\alpha. M1 macrophage markers such as {iNOS} and surface markers including {CD11c} and {CD86} were significantly upregulated while M2 macrophage markers such as Arg1 and {CD206} remained unchanged after {AGEs} stimulation. {AGEs} significantly increased {RAGE} expression in macrophages and activated {NF}-{\kappaB} pathway, and the aforementioned effects were partly abolished by administration of anti-{RAGE} antibody or {NF}-{\kappaB} inhibitor {PDTC}.

Uncontrolled hyperglycemia may be associated with complications such as fluid and electrolyte disturbances and increased infection risk. Studies have demonstrated impairment of host defenses, including decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte mobilization, chemotaxis, and phagocytic activity related to hyperglycemia. Until 2001, hyperglycemia (blood glucose concentrations up to 220 mg/dl) had been tolerated in critically ill patients not only because high blood glucose concentrations were believed to be a normal physiologic reaction in stressed patients and excess glucose is necessary to support the energy needs of glucose-dependent organs, but also because the true significance of short-term hyperglycemia was not known. Recent clinical data show that the use of intensive insulin therapy to maintain tight blood glucose concentrations between 80 and 110 mg/dl decreases morbidity and mortality in critically ill surgical patients. Intensive insulin therapy minimizes derangements in normal host defense mechanisms and modulates release of inflammatory mediators. The principal benefit of intensive insulin therapy is a decrease in infection-related complications and mortality. Further research will define which patient populations will benefit most from intensive insulin therapy and firmly establish the blood glucose concentration at which benefits will be realized.}

We report results from a systematic review to quantify the effects of these antihypertensive drugs on glycaemic control in adults with established diabetes. {METHODS}: We systematically reviewed the literature to identify randomized controlled trials in which glycaemic control was studied in adults with diabetes taking either beta-blockers or diuretics. We combined data on {HbA1c} and fasting blood glucose using fixed effects meta-analysis. {RESULTS}: From 3864 papers retrieved, we found 10 studies of beta-blockers and 12 studies of diuretics to include in the meta-analysis. One study included both comparisons, totalling 21 included reports. Beta-blockers increased fasting blood glucose concentrations by 0.64 mmol l(-1) (95\% {CI} 0.24, 1.03) and diuretics by 0.77 mmol l(-1) (95\% {CI} 0.14, 1.39) compared with placebo. Effect sizes were largest in trials of non-selective beta-blockers (1.33, 95\% {CI} 0.72, 1.95) and thiazide diuretics (1.69, 95\% {CI} 0.60, 2.69). Beta-blockers increased {HbA1c} concentrations by 0.75\% (95\% {CI} 0.30, 1.20) and diuretics by 0.24\% (95\% {CI} -0.17, 0.65) compared with placebo. There was no significant difference in the number of hypoglycaemic events between beta-blockers and placebo in three trials. {CONCLUSIONS}: Randomized trials suggest that thiazide diuretics and non-selective beta-blockers increase fasting blood glucose and {HbA1c} concentrations in patients with diabetes by moderate amounts. These data will inform prescribing and monitoring of beta-blockers and diuretics in patients with diabetes. \copyright 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.}

abstract = {The anti-diabetic and oral hypoglycaemic agent metformin, first used clinically in 1958, is today the first choice or 'gold standard' drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary disease. Of particular importance for the treatment of diabetes, metformin affords protection against diabetes-induced vascular disease. In addition, retrospective analyses suggest that treatment with metformin provides therapeutic benefits to patients with several forms of cancer. Despite almost 60 years of clinical use, the precise cellular mode(s) of action of metformin remains controversial. A direct or indirect role of adenosine monophosphate ({AMP})-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}), the fuel gauge of the cell, has been inferred in many studies, with evidence that activation of {AMPK} may result from a mild inhibitory effect of metformin on mitochondrial complex 1, which in turn would raise {AMP} and activate {AMPK}. Discrepancies, however, between the concentrations of metformin used in in vitro studies versus therapeutic levels suggest that caution should be applied before extending inferences derived from cell-based studies to therapeutic benefits seen in patients. Conceivably, the effects, or some of them, may be at least partially independent of {AMPK} and/or mitochondrial respiration and reflect a direct effect of either metformin or a minor and, as yet, unidentified putative metabolite of metformin on a target protein(s)/signalling cascade. In this review, we critically evaluate the data from studies that have investigated the pharmacokinetic properties and the cellular and clinical basis for the oral hypoglycaemic, insulin-sensitising and vascular protective effects of metformin. \copyright 2015 S.

Approximately half of adults with {CF} have {CF} related diabetes ({CFRD}) and this is associated with increased respiratory decline. {CF} {ASL} contains elevated lactate concentrations and hyperglycaemia can also increase {ASL} lactate. We show that primary human bronchial epithelial ({HBE}) cells secrete lactate into {ASL}, which is elevated in hyperglycaemia. This leads to {ASL} acidification in {CFHBE}, which could only be mimicked in non-{CF} {HBE} following {HCO3}- removal. Hyperglycaemia-induced changes in {ASL} lactate and {pH} were exacerbated by the presence of P. aeruginosa and were attenuated by inhibition of monocarboxylate lactate-H+ co-transporters ({MCTs}) with {AR}-C155858. We conclude that hyperglycaemia and P. aeruginosa induce a metabolic shift which increases lactate generation and efflux into {ASL} via epithelial {MCT2} transporters. Normal airways compensate for {MCT}-driven H+ secretion by secreting {HCO3}-, a process which is dysfunctional in {CF} airway epithelium leading to {ASL} acidification and that these processes may contribute to worsening respiratory disease in {CFRD}.}

While glycosylation is a common host cell process, it is utilized by many pathogens as well. Protein glycosylation is widely employed by viruses for both host invasion and evasion of host immune responses. Thus better understanding of viral glycosylation functions has potential applications for improved antiviral therapeutic and vaccine development. Here, we summarize our current knowledge on the broad biological functions of glycans for the Mononegavirales, an order of enveloped negative-sense single-stranded {RNA} viruses of high medical importance that includes Ebola, rabies, measles and Nipah viruses.

abstract = {Pneumonia, an inflammatory infiltrate of the alveolar airspace, is commonly triggered by bacterial infection of the lungs, or less commonly by viral or fungal infection. It remains the commonest infective reason for admission to intensive care as well as being the most common secondary infection acquired whilst in the intensive care unit ({ICU}). It presents a significant global burden of disease and is especially prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. The major categories of pneumonia encountered by the Intensive Care clinician are community-acquired, ventilator-acquired, non-ventilator hospital-acquired and pneumonia in the immunocompromised patient. An appreciation of the type of pneumonia a patient has developed is critical to its effective treatment. Pneumonia is the commonest precipitant of acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) and clinicians should be mindful that the evidence-base surrounding {ARDS} will, in large part, apply to severe pneumonia. The causative organisms which lead to pneumonia vary depending on the site of acquisition (community or hospital-acquired), the immune status of the patient and the presence of intercurrent medications including antibiotics. Current standard microbiological testing is seldom able to give a rapid answer as to which microorganisms is present and causing infection. Therefore, empirical therapy guided by knowledge of local microbial flora and resistance patterns is the recommended course of action. This approach risks the over-treatment of pneumonia with unnecessarily broad-spectrum agents which bring with them the problems of antibiotic-associated harm. Novel rapid diagnostic tests aimed at both the pathogen and the host response hold promise in the rationalisation and appropriate targeting of antimicrobial therapy. At present neither scoring systems nor diagnostic tests are able to accurately risk stratify a patient\textquoterights need for intensive care admission. Beyond antibiotic therapy, a number of adjuvant therapies have been trialled in pneumonia although none have yet made it into widespread clinical use. Corticosteroids are recommended in some cases of community-acquired pneumonia ({CAP}), but their role in the patient with severe {CAP} in {ICU} remains uncertain whilst they are a risk factor for the development of hospital and ventilator-acquired pneumonia. Immuno-stimulation has not yet translated from small scale clinical trials into clinical use. Supportive management includes lung protective ventilation, and those interventions proven to improve outcomes in {ARDS}. This review will give an overview of the epidemiology of severe pneumonia, the microbiological causes and diagnostic strategies. It will then turn to management, including antimicrobial therapy, role of adjuvant therapies, respiratory support and prevention of complications.}

abstract = {Surfactant, a lipoprotein complex, was originally described for its essential role in reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the lung; however, it is now recognized as being a critical component in lung immune host defense. Surfactant proteins ({SP})-A and -D are pattern recognition molecules of the collectin family of C-type lectins. {SP}-A and {SP}-D are part of the innate immune system and regulate the functions of other innate immune cells, such as macrophages. They also modulate the adaptive immune response by interacting with antigen-presenting cells and T cells, thereby linking innate and adaptive immunity. Emerging studies suggest that {SP}-A and {SP}-D function to modulate the immunologic environment of the lung so as to protect the host and, at the same time, modulate an overzealous inflammatory response that could potentially damage the lung and impair gas exchange. Numerous polymorphisms of {SPs} have been identified that may potentially possess differential functional abilities and may act via different receptors to ultimately alter the susceptibility to or severity of lung diseases.}

abstract = {Innate recognition of viruses is an essential part of the immune response to viral pathogens. This is integral to the maintenance of healthy lungs, which are free from infection and efficient at gaseous exchange. An important component of innate immunity for identifying viruses is the family of C-type collagen-containing lectins, also known as collectins. These secreted, soluble proteins are pattern recognition receptors ({PRRs}) which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns ({PAMPs}), including viral glycoproteins. These innate immune proteins are composed of trimerized units which oligomerise into higher-order structures and facilitate the clearance of viral pathogens through multiple mechanisms. Similarly, many viral surface proteins form trimeric configurations, despite not showing primary protein sequence similarities across the virus classes and families to which they belong. In this review, we discuss the role of the lung collectins, i.e., surfactant proteins A and D ({SP}-A and {SP}-D) in viral recognition. We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved. Recombinant versions of these innate immune proteins may have therapeutic potential in a range of infectious and inflammatory lung diseases including anti-viral therapeutics. \copyright 2018 The Author(s) Published by S.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) recently emerged in Wuhan, Hubei-China, as responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) and then spread rapidly worldwide. While most individuals remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, approximately 5\% develop severe forms of {COVID}-19 characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) and multiple-organ failure ({MOF}) that usually require intensive-care support and often yield a poor prognosis. {SUMMARY}: The pathophysiology of {COVID}-19 is far from being completely understood, and the lack of effective treatments leads to a sense of urgency to develop new therapeutic strategies based on pathophysiological assumptions. The exaggerated cytokine release in response to viral infection, a condition known as cytokine release syndrome ({CRS}) or cytokine storm, is emerging as the mechanism leading to {ARDS} and {MOF} in {COVID}-19, thus endorsing the hypothesis that properly timed anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies could improve patients' clinical outcomes and prognosis. Key Messages: The objective of this article is to explore and comment on the potential role of the promising immunomodulatory therapies using pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to overcome the dysregulated proinflammatory response in {COVID}-19. \copyright 2020 S.

Quantile regression was used to determine discrepant laboratory indexes between survivors and non-survivors and quantile shift ({QS}) was used to quantify the difference. Logistic regression was then used to calculate the odds ratio ({OR}) and the predictive power of death for each risk indicator. {RESULTS}: After adjusting for multiple comparisons and controlling numerous confounders, quantile regression revealed that the laboratory indexes of non-survivors were significantly higher in C-reactive protein ({CRP}; {QS} = 0.835, p \textless  .001), white blood cell counts ({WBC}; {QS} = 0.743, p \textless  .001), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ({AST}; {QS} = 0.735, p \textless  .001), blood glucose ({BG}; {QS} = 0.608, p = .059), fibrin degradation product ({FDP}; {QS} = 0.730, p = .080), and partial pressure of carbon dioxide ({PCO2}), and lower in oxygen saturation ({SO2}; {QS} = 0.312, p \textless  .001), calcium (Ca2+; {QS} = 0.306, p = .073), and {pH}. Most of these indexes were associated with an increased fatality risk, and predictive for the probability of death. Especially, {CRP} is the most prominent index with and odds ratio of 205.97 and predictive accuracy of 93.2\%. {CONCLUSION}: Laboratory indexes provided reliable information on mortality in critically ill patients with {COVID}-19, which might help improve clinical prediction and treatment at an early stage.

Moreover, various studies have emphasized on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant role of metformin, with multiple mechanisms, which activation of {AMPK} by metformin has had a key role in many of them. During the searches on the internet websites of {PubMed}, Elsevier, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, 76 papers related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant role of metformin were selected and reviewed since 2003 to 2017. At the cellular level, metformin suppresses the inflammation in many cases and reduces or eliminates inflammatory factors mainly through dependent mechanisms and sometimes independent of {AMPK} at the cellular level and through other ways at the systematic levels. It is also effective in reducing the level of oxidative stress factors by regulating the antioxidant system of the cell. All evidence suggests the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory role of metformin in various conditions. Metformin can be an appropriate treatment option for many diseases, which inflammatory processes and oxidative stress play a role in their pathogenesis.}

abstract = {For rebooting business and academic activities in the ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic scenario, it is important to pay detailed attention to all forms of infection transfer mechanisms during interaction of people in enclosed environments. In this context, a matter of specific concern will be the possibility of aerosol mediated infection transfer in indoor spaces, which will be largely governed by the size distributions of virus laden droplets, termed as virusols in this work, ejected from humans. We expand on the well-known theory of Poisson fluctuations which acts as statistical barrier against formation of virusols. Analysis suggests that for viral loads of less than 2x10 5 {RNA} copies/{mL}, often corresponding to mild-to-moderate cases of {COVID}-19, droplets of diameter \textless20 micron are unlikely to be of consequence in carrying infections. Cut-off diameters below which droplets will be practically free of contamination, are presented as a function of viral loading. The median diameters of virus laden droplet distributions will be 1.5 to 20 times higher depending upon the Geometric Standard Deviation of the droplet size distributions. The studies have implications to residence time estimates of airborne infections in indoor air and for performance evaluation of sanitation and control technologies to mitigate infection risks in workplaces.}

Hyperglycemia and/or diabetes are noted in approximately 30\%-40\% of patients admitted with {COVID}-19 infections. Previous studies have shown a marked increase in mortality related to increased glucose concentrations and reduction with improved glucose control. In vivo and in vitro studies reveal the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia increases virulence and how glucose control and insulin reduce it. Optimal glucose control in intensive care is limited by manual sampling of glucose and intravenous insulin adjustment, as well as increased nursing workload and the need of protective equipment. Tools for safe and effective automation of glucose control in intensive care are discussed. A suitable closed loop device could save the lives of thousands of hospitalized hyperglycemic individuals infected with {COVID}-19 while protecting medical professionals from infection risk. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.}

The aim of current study was to characterize comparatively the {SP}-D response in bronchoalveolar lavage ({BAL}) and serum in three murine models of lung injury, using a validated {ELISA} technology for estimation of {SP}-D levels. {METHODS}: Mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide, bleomycin, or Pneumocystis carinii (Pc) and sacrificed at different time points. {RESULTS}: In lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice, the level of {SP}-D in {BAL} increased within 6 h, peaked at 51 h (4,518 ng/ml), and returned to base level at 99 h (612 ng/ml). Serum levels of {SP}-D increased immediately (8.6 ng/ml), peaked at 51 h (16 ng/ml), and returned to base levels at 99 h (3.8 ng/ml). In a subacute bleomycin inflammation model, {SP}-D levels were 4,625 and 367 ng/ml in {BAL} and serum, respectively, 8 days after exposure. In a chronic Pc inflammation model, the highest level of {SP}-D was observed 6 weeks after inoculation, with {BAL} and serum levels of 1,868 and 335 ng/ml, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: We conclude that serum levels of {SP}-D increase during lung injury, with a sustained increment during chronic inflammation compared with acute inflammation. A quick upregulation of {SP}-D in serum in response to acute airway inflammation supports the notion that {SP}-D translocates from the airways into the vascular system, in favor of being synthesized systemically. The study also confirms the concept of using increased {SP}-D serum levels as a biomarker of especially chronic airway inflammation.}

The relationships between impaired fasting glucose, other risk factors including blood pressure, and mortality have never been clearly investigated. We studied 63 443 consecutive men (ages 21 to 60 years), each of whom had a routine health examination with a fasting plasma glucose measurement. Men with known ischemic cardiac disease and treatment for diabetes or hypertension were excluded. Impaired fasting glucose was found in 10 773 (17.0\%) of these men. Mean body mass index, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and systolic, diastolic, and pulse blood pressure were significantly higher for men with impaired fasting glucose compared with those men with normal fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 3.9 to 6.0 mmol/L). When adjusted for confounding variables, relative risk of 8-year cardiovascular mortality associated with impaired fasting glucose was dependent on systolic blood pressure level (1.02 [95\% {CI}: 0.62 to 1.70] when \textless 140 mm Hg and 2.10 [95\% {CI}: 1.16 to 3.80] between 140 and 160 mm Hg). Inversely, relative risk of 8-year cardiovascular mortality associated with moderate systolic hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg) compared with normal systolic blood pressure (\textless 140 mm Hg) was highly dependent on the glycemic status (2.97 [95\% {CI}: 1.58 to 5.55] for men with impaired fasting glucose compared with 1.35 [95\% {CI}: 0.84 to 2.18] in those with normal fasting glucose). Similar results were found concerning overall mortality. In conclusion, the presence of moderate systolic hypertension can identify subjects with impaired fasting glucose who are at risk of cardiovascular and overall mortality, and vice versa, probably through the metabolic syndrome.}

To test this hypothesis, we first eliminated from analysis the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants with identifiable diseases or medications known to influence glucose tolerance. Seven hundred forty-three men and women, aged 17-92 yr, remained for analysis. As indices of fatness, body mass index and percent body fat were determined. As indices of body fat distribution, waist-hip ratio and subscapular triceps skin-fold ratio were calculated. As indices of fitness, physical activity level, determined by detailed questionnaire, and maximum 02 consumption were calculated. We tested whether the effect of age on glucose tolerance remains when data were adjusted for fatness, fitness, and fat distribution; 2-h glucose values were 6.61, 6.78, and 7.83 {mM} for young (17-39 yr), middle-aged (40-59 yr), and old (60-92 yr) men and 6.22, 6.22, and 7.28 {mM} for the three groups of women, respectively. The differences between the young and middle-aged groups were not significant, but the old groups had significantly higher values than young or middle-aged groups. Fatness, fitness, and fat distribution can account for the decline in glucose tolerance from the young adult to the middle-aged years. However, age remains a significant determinant of the further decline in glucose tolerance of healthy old subjects.}
