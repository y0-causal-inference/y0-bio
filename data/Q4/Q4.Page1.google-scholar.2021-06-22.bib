abstract = {Virus entry is a multistep process. It initiates when the virus attaches to the host cell and ends when the viral contents reach the cytosol. Genetically unrelated viruses can subvert analogous subcellular mechanisms and use similar trafficking pathways for successful entry. Antiviral strategies targeting early steps of infection are therefore appealing, particularly when the probability for successful interference through a common step is highest. We describe here potent inhibitory effects on content release and infection by chimeric {VSV} containing the envelope proteins of {EBOV} ({VSV}-{EBOV}) or {SARS}-{CoV}-2 ({VSV}-{SARS}-{CoV}-2) elicited by Apilimod and Vacuolin-1, small molecule inhibitors of the main endosomal Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate/Phosphatidylinositol 5-Kinase, {PIKfyve}. We also describe potent inhibition of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 strain 2019-{nCoV}/{USA}-{WA1}/2020 by Apilimod. These results define new tools for studying the intracellular trafficking of pathogens elicited by inhibition of {PIKfyve} kinase and suggest the potential for targeting this kinase in developing a small-molecule antiviral against {SARS}-{CoV}-2.}

abstract = {The causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, highlighting an urgent need to develop antiviral therapies. Here we present a quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics survey of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection in Vero E6 cells, revealing dramatic rewiring of phosphorylation on host and viral proteins. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection promoted casein kinase {II} ({CK2}) and p38 {MAPK} activation, production of diverse cytokines, and shutdown of mitotic kinases, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Infection also stimulated a marked induction of {CK2}-containing filopodial protrusions possessing budding viral particles. Eighty-seven drugs and compounds were identified by mapping global phosphorylation profiles to dysregulated kinases and pathways. We found pharmacologic inhibition of the p38, {CK2}, {CDK}, {AXL}, and {PIKFYVE} kinases to possess antiviral efficacy, representing potential {COVID}-19 therapies.

abstract = {The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), necessitates strategies to identify prophylactic and therapeutic drug candidates for rapid clinical deployment. A high-throughput, high-content imaging assay of human {HeLa} cells expressing the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor {ACE2} was used to screen {ReFRAME}, a best-in-class drug repurposing library. From nearly 12,000 compounds, we identified 66 compounds capable of selectively inhibiting {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication in human cells. Twenty-four of these drugs show additive activity in combination with the {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and may afford increased in vivo efficacy. We also identified synergistic interaction of the nucleoside analog riboprine and a folate antagonist 10-deazaaminopterin with remdesivir. Overall, seven clinically approved drugs (halofantrine, amiodarone, nelfinavir, simeprevir, manidipine, ozanimod, osimertinib) and 19 compounds in other stages of development may have the potential to be repurposed as {SARS}-{CoV}-2 oral therapeutics based on their potency, pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles.}

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 is a newly emerging infectious disease currently spreading across the world. It is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2). The spike (S) protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process, is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion by forming a six-helical bundle via the two-heptad repeat domain. In this review, we highlight recent research advance in the structure, function and development of antivirus drugs targeting the S protein.}

abstract = {The endocytic pathway is a common strategy that several highly pathogenic viruses use to enter into the cell. To demonstrate the usefulness of this pathway as a common target for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals, the inhibitory effect of drug compounds targeting endosomal membrane proteins were investigated. This study entailed direct comparison of drug effectiveness against animal and human pathogenic viruses, namely Ebola ({EBOV}), African swine fever virus ({ASFV}), and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2). A panel of experimental and {FDA}-approved compounds targeting calcium channels and {PIKfyve} at the endosomal membrane caused potent reductions of entry up to 90\% in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S-protein pseudotyped retrovirus. Similar inhibition was observed against transduced {EBOV} glycoprotein pseudovirus and {ASFV}. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection was potently inhibited by selective estrogen receptor modulators in cells transduced with pseudovirus, among them Raloxifen inhibited {ASFV} with very low 50\% inhibitory concentration. Finally, the mechanism of the inhibition caused by the latter in {ASFV} infection was analyzed. Overall, this work shows that cellular proteins related to the endocytic pathway can constitute suitable cellular targets for broad range antiviral compounds. Copyright \copyright 2020 The Author(s).

abstract = {Since the initial report of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) emanating from Wuhan, China, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has spread globally. While the effects of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection are not completely understood, there appears to be a wide spectrum of disease ranging from mild symptoms to severe respiratory distress, hospitalization, and mortality. There are no Food and Drug Administration ({FDA})-approved treatments for {COVID}-19 aside from remdesivir; early efforts to identify efficacious therapeutics for {COVID}-19 have mainly focused on drug repurposing screens to identify compounds with antiviral activity against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in cellular infection systems. These screens have yielded intriguing hits, but the use of nonhuman immortalized cell lines derived from non-pulmonary or gastrointestinal origins poses any number of questions in predicting the physiological and pathological relevance of these potential interventions. While our knowledge of this novel virus continues to evolve, our current understanding of the key molecular and cellular interactions involved in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection is discussed in order to provide a framework for developing the most appropriate in vitro toolbox to support current and future drug discovery efforts.}
