abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: It has been proposed that high insulin levels may cause delayed lung development in the fetuses of diabetic mothers. A key event in lung development is the production of adequate amounts of pulmonary surfactant. Insulin inhibits the expression of surfactant protein A ({SP}-A), the major surfactant-associated protein, in lung epithelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in insulin inhibition of {SP}-A gene expression. {METHODS}: H441 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, or human fetal lung explants were incubated with or without insulin. Transcription run-on assays were used to determine {SP}-A gene transcription rates. Northern blot analysis was used to examine the effect of various signal transduction inhibitors on {SP}-A gene expression. Immunoblot analysis was used to evaluate the levels and phosphorylation states of signal transduction protein kinases. {RESULTS}: Insulin decreased {SP}-A gene transcription in human lung epithelial cells within 1 hour. Insulin did not affect p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) phosphorylation and the insulin inhibition of {SP}-A {mRNA} levels was not affected by {PD98059}, an inhibitor of the p44/42 {MAPK} pathway. In contrast, insulin increased p70 S6 kinase Thr389 phosphorylation within 15 minutes. Wortmannin or {LY294002}, both inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ({PI} 3-kinase), or rapamycin, an inhibitor of the activation of p70 S6 kinase, a downstream effector in the {PI} 3-kinase pathway, abolished or attenuated the insulin-induced inhibition of {SP}-A {mRNA} levels. {CONCLUSION}: Insulin inhibition of {SP}-A gene expression in lung epithelial cells probably occurs via the rapamycin-sensitive {PI} 3-kinase signaling pathway.}

abstract = {Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and asthma are all rapidly increasing globally. Substantial emerging evidence suggests that these three conditions are epidemiologically and mechanistically linked. Since the link between obesity and asthma appears to extend beyond mechanical pulmonary disadvantage, molecular understanding is necessary. Insulin resistance is a strong, independent risk factor for asthma development, but it is unknown whether a direct effect of insulin on the lung is involved. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the effect of insulin on cellular components of the lung and highlights the molecular consequences of insulin-related metabolic signaling cascades that could adversely affect lung structure and function. Examples include airway smooth muscle proliferation and contractility and regulatory signaling networks that are associated with asthma. These aspects of insulin signaling provide mechanistic insight into the clinical evidence for the links between obesity, metabolic syndrome, and airway diseases, setting the stage for novel therapeutic avenues targeting these conditions.}

abstract = {Cellular metabolism is dynamic, but quantifying non-steady metabolic fluxes by stable isotope tracers presents unique computational challenges. Here, we developed an efficient {13C}-tracer dynamic metabolic flux analysis ({13C}-{DMFA}) framework for modeling central carbon fluxes that vary over time. We used B-splines to generalize the flux parameterization system and to improve the stability of the optimization algorithm. As proof of concept, we investigated how {3T3}-L1 cultured adipocytes acutely metabolize glucose in response to insulin. Insulin rapidly stimulates glucose uptake, but intracellular pathways responded with differing speeds and magnitudes. Fluxes in lower glycolysis increased faster than those in upper glycolysis. Glycolysis fluxes rose disproportionally larger and faster than the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with lactate a primary glucose end product. The uncovered array of flux dynamics suggests that glucose catabolism is additionally regulated beyond uptake to help shunt glucose into appropriate pathways. This work demonstrates the value of using dynamic intracellular fluxes to understand metabolic function and pathway regulation. Copyright \copyright 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Understanding the pathophysiological effects of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 on these pathways is needed, particularly given the current lack of proven, effective treatments. The vasoconstrictive, prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory conditions induced by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 can be ascribed, at least in part, to the activation of these intersecting physiological networks. Moreover, patients with immune deficiencies, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and kidney disease often have altered activation of these pathways, either due to underlying disease or to medications, and may be more susceptible to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. Certain characteristic {COVID}-associated skin, sensory, and central nervous system manifestations may also be linked to viral activation of the {RAAS}, complement, coagulation, and {KKS} pathways. Pharmacological interventions that target molecules along these pathways may be useful in mitigating symptoms and preventing organ or tissue damage. While effective anti-viral therapies are critically needed, further study of these pathways may identify effective adjunctive treatments and patients most likely to benefit.

Immune-mediated pathology is a key player in this disease; hence, the role of the complement system needs assessment. The complement system and the coagulation cascade share an intricate network, where multiple mediators maintain a balance between both pathways. Coagulopathy in {COVID}-19, showing mixed features of complement-mediated and consumption coagulopathy, creates a dilemma in diagnosis and management. {AREAS} {COVERED}: Pathophysiology of coagulopathy in {COVID}-19 patients, with a particular focus on D-dimer and its role in predicting the severity of {COVID}-19 has been discussed. A comprehensive search of the medical literature on {PubMed} was done till May 30th, 2020 with the keywords '{COVID}-19', '{SARS}-{CoV}-2', 'Coronavirus', 'Coagulopathy', and 'D-dimer'. Twenty-two studies were taken for weighted pooled analysis of D-dimer. {EXPERT} {OPINION}: A tailored anticoagulant regimen, including intensification of standard prophylactic regimens with low-molecular-weight heparin is advisable for {COVID}-19 patients. Atypical manifestations and varying D-dimer levels seen in different populations bring forth the futility of uniform recommendations for anticoagulant therapy. Further, direct thrombin inhibitors and platelet inhibitors in a patient-specific manner should also be considered.}

However, low protein concentrations, genetic variation, biochemical modification, and proteolytic breakdown can induce decomposition of multimeric {SP}-D into low-molecular weight forms, which may induce pro-inflammatory {SP}-D signaling. Multimeric {SP}-D can decompose into trimeric {SP}-D, and this process, and total {SP}-D levels, are partly determined by variation within the {SP}-D gene, {SFTPD}. {SP}-D has been implicated in the development of respiratory diseases including respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, allergic asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disease-induced breakdown or modifications of {SP}-D facilitate its systemic leakage from the lung, and circulatory {SP}-D is a promising biomarker for lung injury. Moreover, studies in preclinical animal models have demonstrated that local pulmonary treatment with recombinant {SP}-D is beneficial in these diseases. In recent years, {SP}-D has been shown to exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects in various non-pulmonary organs and to have effects on lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory effects in vessel walls, which enhance the risk of atherosclerosis. A common {SFTPD} polymorphism is associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes, and {SP}-D has been associated with metabolic disorders because of its effects in the endothelium and adipocytes and its obesity-dampening properties. This review summarizes and discusses the reported genetic associations of {SP}-D with disease and the clinical utility of circulating {SP}-D for respiratory disease prognosis. Moreover, basic research on the mechanistic links between {SP}-D and respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases is summarized. Perspectives on the development of {SP}-D therapy are addressed.}

Human surfactant protein D ({SP}-D) is known to interact with spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}, but its immune-surveillance against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is not known. The study aimed to examine the potential of a recombinant fragment of human {SP}-D ({rfhSP}-D) as an inhibitor of replication and infection of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The interaction of {rfhSP}-D with spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {hACE}-2 receptor was predicted via docking analysis. The inhibition of interaction between spike protein and {ACE}-2 by {rfhSP}-D was confirmed using direct and indirect {ELISA}. The effect of {rfhSP}-D on replication and infectivity of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 from clinical samples was studied by measuring the expression of {RdRp} gene of the virus using {qPCR}. In-silico interaction studies indicated that three amino acid residues in the {RBD} of spike of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 were commonly involved in interacting with {rfhSP}-D and {ACE}-2. Studies using clinical samples of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 positive cases (asymptomatic, n=7 and symptomatic, n=8 and negative controls n=15) demonstrated that treatment with 1.67 {\muM} {rfhSP}-D inhibited viral replication by \~5.5 fold and was more efficient than Remdesivir (100 {\muM}). Approximately, a 2-fold reduction in viral infectivity was also observed after treatment with 1.67 {\muM} {rfhSP}-D. These results conclusively demonstrate that the calcium independent {rfhSP}-D mediated inhibition of binding between the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike protein and human {ACE}-2, its host cell receptor, and a significant reduction in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and replication in-vitro.

Unfortunately it also clear that aspects of innate immunity can lead to severe morbidity or mortality from {IAV}, including inflammatory lung injury, bacterial superinfection, and exacerbation of reactive airways disease. We review broadly the virus and host factors that result in adverse outcomes from {IAV} and show evidence that inflammatory responses can become damaging even apart from changes in viral replication per se, with special focus on the positive and adverse effects of neutrophils and monocytes. We then evaluate in detail the role of soluble innate inhibitors including surfactant protein D and antimicrobial peptides that have a potential dual capacity for down-regulating viral replication and also inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses and how these innate host factors could possibly be harnessed to treat {IAV} infection. Where appropriate we draw comparisons and contrasts the {SARS}-{CoV} viruses and {IAV} in an effort to point out where the extensive knowledge existing regarding severe {IAV} infection could help guide research into severe {COVID} 19 illness or vice versa.

abstract = {Exposure to air pollutants has been previously associated with respiratory viral infections, including influenza, measles, mumps, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiological studies have also suggested that air pollution exposure is associated with increased cases of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and {COVID}-19-associated mortality, although the molecular mechanisms by which pollutant exposure affects viral infection and pathogenesis of {COVID}-19 remain unknown. In this review, we suggest potential molecular mechanisms that could account for this association. We have focused on the potential effect of exposure to nitrogen dioxide ({NO2} ), ozone (O3 ), and particulate matter ({PM}) since there are studies investigating how exposure to these pollutants affects the life cycle of other viruses. We have concluded that pollutant exposure may affect different stages of the viral life cycle, including inhibition of mucociliary clearance, alteration of viral receptors and proteases required for entry, changes to antiviral interferon production and viral replication, changes in viral assembly mediated by autophagy, prevention of uptake by macrophages, and promotion of viral spread by increasing epithelial permeability. We believe that exposure to pollutants skews adaptive immune responses toward bacterial/allergic immune responses, as opposed to antiviral responses. Exposure to air pollutants could also predispose exposed populations toward developing {COIVD}-19-associated immunopathology, enhancing virus-induced tissue inflammation and damage. \copyright 2020 New York Academy of Sciences.}
