abstract = {The coronavirus {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has infected more than 600,000 people and has overwhelmed hospital systems around the world. However, the factors mediating fatal {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that {ACE2} is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in {ACE2} expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung {ACE2} levels. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly likely to develop severe {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections, and they suggest that quitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibility.}

abstract = {Understanding innate immune responses in {COVID}-19 is important to decipher mechanisms of host responses and interpret disease pathogenesis. Natural killer ({NK}) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections but might also contribute to immunopathology. Using 28-color flow cytometry, we here reveal strong {NK} cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of {COVID}-19 patients. This pattern was mirrored in {scRNA}-seq signatures of {NK} cells in bronchoalveolar lavage from {COVID}-19 patients. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis of peripheral blood {NK} cells furthermore identified distinct {NK} cell immunotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunotypes were high expression of perforin, {NKG2C}, and Ksp37, reflecting increased presence of adaptive {NK} cells in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of {CD56bright} {NK} cells was observed across {COVID}-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors.

abstract = {To predict the tropism of human coronaviruses, we profile 28 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors ({SCARFs}) using single-cell transcriptomics across various healthy human tissues. {SCARFs} include cellular factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Intestinal goblet cells, enterocytes, and kidney proximal tubule cells appear highly permissive to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, consistent with clinical data. Our analysis also predicts non-canonical entry paths for lung and brain infections. Spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells also appear to be permissive to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, suggesting male-specific vulnerabilities. Both pro- and anti-viral factors are highly expressed within the nasal epithelium, with potential age-dependent variation, predicting an important battleground for coronavirus infection. Our analysis also suggests that early embryonic and placental development are at moderate risk of infection. Lastly, {SCARF} expression appears broadly conserved across a subset of primate organs examined. Our study establishes a resource for investigations of coronavirus biology and pathology.

The alveolar epithelium is a major target of the virus, but representative models to study virus host interactions in more detail are currently lacking. Here, we describe a human {2D} air-liquid interface culture system which was characterized by confocal and electron microscopy and single-cell {mRNA} expression analysis. In this model, alveolar cells, but also basal cells and rare neuroendocrine cells, are grown from {3D} self-renewing fetal lung bud tip organoids. These cultures were readily infected by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 with mainly surfactant protein C-positive alveolar type {II}-like cells being targeted. Consequently, significant viral titers were detected and {mRNA} expression analysis revealed induction of type I/{III} interferon response program. Treatment of these cultures with a low dose of interferon lambda 1 reduced viral replication. Hence, these cultures represent an experimental model for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and can be applied for drug screens. \copyright 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {Infection with {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the virus that causes {COVID}-19, can lead to severe lower respiratory illness including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can result in profound morbidity and mortality. However, many infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have isolated upper respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the upper airways represent the initial site of viral infection, and that some individuals are able to largely constrain viral pathology to the nasal and oropharyngeal tissues. Which cell types in the human nasopharynx are the primary targets of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, and how infection influences the cellular organization of the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. Here, we present nasopharyngeal samples from a cohort of 35 individuals with {COVID}-19, representing a wide spectrum of disease states from ambulatory to critically ill, as well as 23 healthy and intubated patients without {COVID}-19. Using standard nasopharyngeal swabs, we collected viable cells and performed single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq), simultaneously profiling both host and viral {RNA}. We find that following infection with {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the upper respiratory epithelium undergoes massive reorganization: secretory cells diversify and expand, and mature epithelial cells are preferentially lost. Further, we observe evidence for deuterosomal cell and immature ciliated cell expansion, potentially representing active repopulation of lost ciliated cells through coupled secretory cell differentiation. Epithelial cells from participants with mild/moderate {COVID}-19 show extensive induction of genes associated with anti-viral and type I interferon responses. In contrast, cells from participants with severe lower respiratory symptoms appear globally muted in their anti-viral capacity, despite substantially higher local inflammatory myeloid populations and equivalent nasal viral loads. This suggests an essential role for intrinsic, local epithelial immunity in curbing and constraining viral-induced pathology. Using a custom computational pipeline, we characterized cell-associated {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RNA} and identified rare cells with {RNA} intermediates strongly suggestive of active replication. Both within and across individuals, we find remarkable diversity and heterogeneity among {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RNA}+ host cells, including developing/immature and interferon-responsive ciliated cells, {KRT13}+ "hillock"-like cells, and unique subsets of secretory, goblet, and squamous cells. Finally, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RNA}+ cells, as compared to uninfected bystanders, are enriched for genes involved in susceptibility (e.g., {CTSL} , {TMPR\SS2} ) or response (e.g., {MX1} , {IFITM3} , {EIF2AK2} ) to infection. Together, this work defines both protective and detrimental host responses to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, determines the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed anti-viral epithelial immunity in the nasal mucosa may underlie the progression to severe {COVID}-19.}

We assessed the cell-type-specific expression of {ACE2}, {TMPR\SS2} and {CTSL} across 107 single-cell {RNA}-sequencing studies from different tissues. {ACE2}, {TMPR\SS2} and {CTSL} are coexpressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways and alveoli, and in cells from other organs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) transmission or pathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell {RNA}-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals. This revealed cell-type-specific associations of age, sex and smoking with expression levels of {ACE2}, {TMPR\SS2} and {CTSL}. Expression of entry factors increased with age and in males, including in airway secretory cells and alveolar type 2 cells. Expression programs shared by {ACE2}+{TMPR\SS2}+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues included genes that may mediate viral entry, key immune functions and epithelial-macrophage cross-talk, such as genes involved in the interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and complement pathways. Cell-type-specific expression patterns may contribute to the pathogenesis of {COVID}-19, and our work highlights putative molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention.}

Enhanced understanding of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To provide insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, we performed single-cell (sc) {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells ({HBECs}) in air-liquid interface ({ALI}) cultures over a time course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target at the onset of infection, which we confirmed by electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Over the course of infection, the cell tropism of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type {III} interferons ({IFNs}) and interleukin ({IL})-6 but not {IL}-1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes ({ISGs}) in both infected and bystander cells. This provides a detailed characterization of genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection in the human airway.}

abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: The high mortality of specific groups from {COVID}-19 highlights the importance of host-viral interactions and the potential benefits from enhancing host defenses. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) 2 as a receptor for cell entry and infection. Although both {ACE} inhibitors and spironolactone can upregulate tissue {ACE2}, there are important points of discrimination between these approaches. The virus requires proteolytic processing of its spike protein by transmembrane protease receptor serine type 2 ({TMPR\SS2}) to enable binding to cellular {ACE2}. Because {TMPR\SS2} contains an androgen promoter, it may be downregulated by the antiandrogenic actions of spironolactone. Furin and plasmin also process the spike protein. They are inhibited by protease nexin 1 or serpin E2 ({PN1}) that is upregulated by angiotensin {II} but downregulated by aldosterone. Therefore, spironolactone should selectively downregulate furin and plasmin. Furin also promotes pulmonary edema, whereas plasmin promotes hemovascular dysfunction. Thus, a downregulation of furin and plasmin by {PN1} could be a further benefit of {MRAs} beyond their well-established organ protection. We review the evidence that spironolactone may be the preferred {RA\SSi} to increase {PN1} and decrease {TMPR\SS2}, furin, and plasmin activities and thereby reduce viral cell binding, entry, infectivity, and bad outcomes. This hypothesis requires direct investigation. Copyright \copyright 2020 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.}
